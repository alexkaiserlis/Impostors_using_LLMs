His ABBA Port had sounded young, but clearly, now wasn't the time for trying to guess the sentry's age.

She couldn't decide whether he genuinely didn't know, or if he wasn't permitted to tell her, so she had to take the risk.

As she leaned to open the doors, a loud, masculine moan filled the air, and she blushed. If this was a battle, why couldn't she hear the clashing of swords? Or perhaps the commotion of a physical struggle, the sound of chairs being overturned, and bodies hitting the floor?

Now suspicious of what she might find, the servant-girl hesitated. Should she really barge in on the King during his private moments, perhaps indulging in self-pleasure? But she needed to inform him that the conference was awaiting his presence. Should she wait until he was done?

Reaha blushed again as she heard a low growl emit from His Majesty's chambers, followed by the consistent small sounds, which, upon reflection, could possibly be described as moans or whimpers. Wasn't the King alone?

How embarrassing.

Of course, that was why the guards, who undoubtedly heard the moans and groans coming from the King's chambers, hadn't intervened earlier. Certainly, they had heard – Reaha was surprised the entire castle hadn't been stirred awake by the commotion.

She waited in an awkward silence for the noises to cease, her face constantly red. By the time the tranquility returned to the King's chambers, she was already feeling lightheaded and dizzy from blushing for so long. She was no physician, but even she knew something was amiss when the room started spinning to the right. Why to the right?

Closing her eyes and taking a deep breath, she composed herself until the dizzy spell passed.

She was about to push the doors open with renewed determination when they opened from the inside, causing her to step back to avoid being struck by the hard wood. Looking up, she felt her mouth drop open and her eyes widen in surprise.

In front of her stood a tall, blond Elf, his hair a disheveled mess held back by two perfect, slender braids, revealing his remarkably pointed ears. She had never seen an Elf's ears from such close proximity and was fascinated by their angular tips. Naturally, he looked exquisite. His fair, Elven complexion was flawless. He grimaced upon catching sight of her, and although she hadn't thought it possible, she blushed even more deeply. Her confusion grew as she recognized the face of the Prince of Mirkwood, who had accompanied the Company sent to Gondor from the Elven Colony. She had caught a fleeting glimpse of him when they first arrived. He had led the Company as they rode on immaculate white horses through the gates of Minas Tirith. Naturally, the crown greatly facilitated the identification.

"W-…oh- …good morning, Your Highness," she said quickly, bowing at the waist before the Prince, tripping over her words, much to her embarrassment.

Raising her head slightly, she saw him give her a warm smile. She interpreted it as a signal to rise. "It is," he remarked, his mellifluous voice soft as silk and sweet as honey.

She stood there, still slightly hunched from her profound bow, wide-eyed and gazing at the handsome Prince, shock evident on her face as she found herself captivated by him. Everything about him was just so attractive, flawless, and delicate. Elf-like, she surmised.

"Legolas," called a gruff voice, and suddenly the King appeared in the doorway of his chambers, without a tunic and bare-chested. She looked down quickly, her flushed cheeks growing even redder, and colors swarming into her vision for no apparent reason. It was not difficult to speculate on what the two Royals had been doing only minutes before, even for someone as young as Reaha, but she had never heard of two men engaging in such acts together. It must be… No, she could not think of the King in that manner. It was disrespectful and dishonorable.

Remaining in the prostrated position she had adopted when the King appeared, she could just about make out that the King didn't even spare her a glance. It was for the best, of course, as she could not contain her blushing any more than she could control her wandering thoughts.

"Bow."

Confused by the King's command, as she was already bowing deeply and respectfully before him, Reaha didn't move and waited for him to clarify.

"Ni 'lassui," spoke the Elf Prince, and there was the sound of something changing hands. Reaha didn't dare look up to see what it was, for she might have failed to fulfill the King's ambiguous directive to bow and did not want to risk her luck.
