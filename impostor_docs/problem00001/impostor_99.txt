He must be nervous about what might come next. He's unsure about the night ahead but could possibly want them to visit him. He thinks about Derek, Laura, and Peter standing alone at the altar, having buried the rest of their family. Jackson doesn't have much of a family, never having known his birth parents. He had been close to the Whittemores before learning about his adoption which made him feel detached and like he didn't belong. He initially didn't want them at his wedding, but he imagines how he would feel if they hadn't showed up. He agrees to speak with Derek about arranging a visit for dinner once things are more settled. Lady Whittemore looks like she might cry and Jackson, feeling overwhelmed, leaves to find solace with Kanima before heading to Hale Manor. He is greeted as Master Hale and goes to his quarters where he finds Derek waiting to discuss estate business with him.
