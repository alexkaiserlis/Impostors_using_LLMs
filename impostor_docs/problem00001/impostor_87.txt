Castiel's silence is then disrupted by someone calling Dean out on his attraction to Novak, to which Dean's friends chime in with agreement, pointing out the time he'd spend with Novak. Dean, clearly flustered, turns to Cas, who asks him if it's true. Dean stammers in response, and a smile creeps onto Cas's face, leading to cheers and taunts from their peers. Meanwhile, Gabriel finds Crowley in hiding from Lucifer's minions and engages in a conversation, intending to catch up with his old friend Crowley.
