I knew ya loved me,” John said, shakily stepping into the water. "You coming in? Make sure I’m warm enough?" Illyria replied, her blood-dark armor melting from her lithe frame as she stepped into the tub and slid in behind him. John leaned back against her chest with a sigh, draping his arms along her legs. "The one thing I miss about Hell is the climate." Illyria agreed, "You will not find temperatures similar to those environs anywhere on any planet that is livable. Unless you wish to reside in the middle of a volcano." John replied, "El Azizia came close. This is a sort of vacation for us. No hunting possible for over a year; we’ll be able to just kick back and relax." Illyria asked, "However will you manage? You go a few days without hunting something and you turn into an unpleasant pain in my backside." John replied, "It’s ass and thank you so very much." Illyria continued, "You are welcome. It shows personal growth that you have learned to accept your flaws. It's too constricting while bathing," she said, as she gripped him firmly in her hand. John groaned softly, unable to formulate a response to her teasing tone. Instead, he turned to nuzzle at the column of her throat.
