He’s startled to see Stiles, but Stiles knows him. He’s happy when Stiles pushes a paw at him and sniffs at his neck, even if Stiles thinks it’s gross.

He wants to nip at Stiles, but then he spots the rabbit and he’s off running. When he returns, Stiles is gone. 

He feels silly and embarrassed as soon as he shifts back, but Stiles doesn’t say anything about it.

When he hears Stiles’ Jeep, he runs towards him, and Stiles looks happy to see him. Stiles smells happy and relaxed, and has a bit of nervousness and uncertainty in his scent.

Stiles brings out a new store-bought tennis ball. Derek rushes back into the forest when Stiles throws the ball, and he feels happy. 

He’s surprised at how small and green the creature that made him crazy is. He’s certain he’s sent it back home, but still feels anxious afterwards.

He ends up under Stiles’ window, and hops up on the bed to curl into a ball next to Stiles, who is asleep and smells of hurt and sickness. 

He hears John talking in his sleep and finally wakes him up. John realizes that he was talking in his sleep and Rodney lies about not hearing what he said. They settle back down and fall asleep again.

John wakes up feeling rested and finds Rodney's hand on his arm, feeling a strange affinity for him.
