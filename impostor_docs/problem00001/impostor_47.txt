--suddenly and unexpectedly engulfs her in a hug. Itâ€™s really good to see you, Rory, " he says. 
"You too," she says when he's released her, and it really, really is. She feels five years worth of news and questions bubbling up inside her, but she can't find a place to start, just stands there awkwardly.
"So, this is Rory?" the stall owner - Cassie - says finally. She rolls her eyes at Dean when he still makes no move to introduce her, and holds out her hand to Rory. "I'm Cassie."
"Sorry, Cassie." Dean gives her a quick hug, pressing a kiss to her cheek. "I was just so surprised to see Rory. You mind if the two of us take off for a while?"
"Do you have time? It would be good to catch up," Dean asks Rory. 
"I mumble my assent, and Dean grins," wicked glint in his eye. "I can show you a good place for round cakes," he says.
Rory ends up with a square cake, actually - a slab of shortbread with thick caramel oozing out from under the hard chocolate topping. Dean gets a doughnut, raspberry jelly spurting out from its heart when he takes a bite. Dean looks pretty much the same - broader now, finally grown into his lanky frame, and subtly different in a way that reminds her of all the ways she's changed in the last five years, but still recognisably the same boy she knew.
"So," he asks, wiping a smudge of jelly off his lip with his thumb. "What have you been doing? I heard about the campaign trail job, but I kind of lost track after that."
"I got a job in Washington after that -" she begins, and then checks herself. "No, wait, tell me about you. I never even heard you'd left Stars Hollow."
