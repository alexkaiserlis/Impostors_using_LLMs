Georgi left. He had no idea where he was headed, not paying attention to where he was going. When he bumped into someone, he looked up. Christophe took one look at him and took his hand to lead him to another secluded corner, where he made Georgi sit on the floor leaning on Chris’s shoulder. “It happened?”

“She cheated. I don’t even know if it’s her soulmate, but she could have at least told me.”

“After all this time? I wonder why now?”

Georgi shook his head. “I don’t know. She never really told me anything about him. Maybe he was dating someone else, and that ended?”

“That would be a rather amusingly long chain of breakups.”

“I know. It’s just easier to think that than to wonder if she’s been cheating on me this whole time.”

Chris kissed the top of Georgi’s head. “I’m so sorry.”

“Do you… are you seeing anyone at the moment?”

“No. Good timing, I suppose… things with Stefan fell apart a few days ago.”
