----Bruce hesitated. It was yet another of Tonys endless gatherings that he was forced to attend. To be honest, he would have much rather stayed in the lab or in his room. But Tony practically dragged him towards the main area of the party, insisting that Bruce should loosen up and have fun. And the worst part? You weren't even present! The one person he could converse with was not there, so he simply stood awkwardly against the wall, holding a glass of something to drink. He just hoped nobody would provoke his anger.

His gaze roamed aimlessly around the room, never lingering on anything or anyone for long. Something in the corner of his vision caught his attention, and he shifted his focus. His breath caught in his throat. There you were, nervously clutching a purse, wearing a dress he had never seen on you before that accentuated your figure. Your hair was down for once, the soft strands framing your face. Your hair was typically tied up, even at the tower. Of course, having your hair down would be quite inconvenient in the lab, but he had seen you with your hair up even when you were just hanging around in the tower.

Finally, you noticed Bruce and hurried to his side. He greeted you warmly, hoping you would not notice the red tint on his cheeks from the alcohol. You greeted him as well, blushing as you looked down at yourself. "I... I must look ridiculous," you murmured. "No, I mean, no. You actually look quite beautiful," he replied, and you raised your eyebrows in confusion. "Thanks, but... do you have any idea who this is from?" you asked, gesturing to the dress. "It was just lying on my bed this morning. There was a note too, something about wearing this dress today, arriving late, and dolling myself up." - "I don't know who it's from. But I have a suspicion..." You shook your head. "You're thinking Tony, right? I asked him first, but he's never seen the dress before." - "Well, he could have lied," Bruce said, taking a sip from his drink to disguise his nervousness. You truly looked beautiful that evening.

You and Bruce stood there and chatted for quite a while, until a stranger inserted himself between the two of you. He leaned against the wall, grinning flirtatiously at you. "Hey, sweet cheeks. Never seen you here before. How's it going?" You certainly did not want to engage in conversation with this man. You looked at Bruce for help. "Actually, we were just about to go dance," Bruce interjected, stepping around the guy and halting beside you. "Oh. Were you now?" The man looked at you, raising an eyebrow. "Yeah, we were!" you exclaimed, grabbing Bruce's arm and starting to pull him toward the dance floor.

Suddenly, the music transitioned to something slow, which was not typical of Tony's party playlist. Awkwardly, Bruce and you held onto each other as you began to sway to the music. You had to admit, it was rather pleasant.

Across the room, Clint and Natasha high-fived. Their mission had been a great success.
