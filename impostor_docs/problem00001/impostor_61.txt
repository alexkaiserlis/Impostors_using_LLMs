I had to visit the King. I was hesitant, and when I finally tried to enter his chambers, I was surprised by an unexpected encounter with the Prince of Mirkwood. I was mesmerized by his beauty and elegance. Suddenly, the King appeared bare-chested, and I was taken aback, feeling bewildered and embarrassed. I was then instructed to bow in their presence. The situation felt awkward, and I couldn't help blushing furiously.
