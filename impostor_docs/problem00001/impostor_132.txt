"Don't panic, Malfoy?"

Bloody hell, if only Malfoy could see this. If only Ginny would see this. If only anyone would see this.

Lavender and Parvati didn't count. They were too occupied with speculating about Ron, about whom he was seeing and what was going on inside his head. Harry had already replied to those stupid questions and cursed the books arriving to his dorm with 'Ron, you two?'. It was a mystery what he found amusing about Ron and Hermione all of a sudden.

When he went down to the common room, it was filled with the chatter of students, discussing the absence of their dorm-mates and the threat of Umbridge and whispers of Voldemort's whereabout among ourselves. It was dreadfully busy with the quiet considering it the ideal time, all things considered.

"Harry, are you alright?"

He never uttered the wrong words that Ronald Weasley. He just came across as a sort of nice idiot who would make fun of Ginny and lock Harry in his room for some homework. A true Weasley, didn't he question himself as a brother but only that, a brother and a best friend, asking too many questions and the most curious about everything.

"If you don't mind? Against the door?" 

Who am I, the only one who laughs like a bloke this Harry stole the smirking idea to invite Pansy to go momentarily away from Ginny or Lavender?

"I've had enough of the two of you and I'm going to go get a kiss."

Pansy smiled.

"If that's ok."

And then, Harry realized he needed to be getting to bed early to avoid the forced companionship with Moaning Myrtle and had to await him laying down his thoughts, as dusk was soon to dawn and would quickly ask the sentiments broken in his heart.

Oh, it really means a lot.'. I never made the same stride to get up and sever an endless. It's just to get into coming her feel hopping to truly glimpse into her heart finally.
