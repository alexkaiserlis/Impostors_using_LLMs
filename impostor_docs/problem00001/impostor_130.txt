You had started your job at this moment, not shortly after you were at his beck and call. Your hand had moved to his crotch, leaving his pants tight almost immediately. You tried on lingerie. "Can you come help me for just a moment?" Your body was clad in black and white lingerie. You teased him, palming him through his jeans, as steps grew louder. Giggling, you shooed him out, leaving you and John in silence again.

You settled in a caf√©, focusing on the table. You teased him once again. All the teasing, all the edging. He needed to cum, he really did. Afterwards, you were in a cinema watching a random movie. The desire was still burning inside him. Your hand went to work. Almost immediately, your hand went to work on his pants. You kept stroking him slowly, rubbing the head of his cock with your thumb. He came all over your hand. You settled down content with watching the movie.

You were now faced with the man before you. He had a blank expression. Your fingers kneaded your wrists. "Who are-" You were interrupted. "I've been watching you." That sent shivers up your spine. Your stalker? Had he seen you naked? Your legs felt weak. "You set that house on fire after you killed that person." Your eyes widened. He knew? "You can't lie to me. I was there the same night just to see the house go up in flames."

He smirked a little. "I want to make you an offer. I want you to work for me," he said, not taking his eyes off his hand. He walked towards you and left through the only door leading out of the room. He left it open, signaling that you were free to leave as well.

The next weeks were crazy. You started seeing him everywhere. He was driving you insane. After three weeks you snapped. You dialled the number. "Nothing?" You were dumbstruck. "I knew you were going to give in soon," he said as he walked out of your bathroom, smiling.
