– "being an obnoxious little shit is the way to make me pick you instead?" Rykov shrugged and picked up another rock. "You just said you don’t want me as your soulmate because it'll mess up your friendship with Yuuri. I can't exactly leave, so what do you want me to do?"

"How about you drop the attitude and introduce yourself? I don’t even know you beyond the statements you’ve made about my friend."

"Right, because a punch to the face makes me feel like opening up. But sure! My name’s Valery Olegovich Rykov, call me Valera, I’m fifteen, I’ll turn sixteen in August, I like skating and dogs and working in my garden. My older sister just got married but I couldn’t go to the wedding because I was in Sheffield, I have a younger brother who was my best friend until I left to train with Karl and I never get to see him anymore, and do you actually give a damn about anything I’ve said?" Paul was going to respond, but Rykov cut him off. "Wait, you probably care about the sixteen in August. The 14th, to be specific, so you know when I’m going to find out about this and you can hit me for real when I come looking for you."

"I’m not going to…" Paul threw up his hands. "Fine. Be like that. See you in two and a half years."

Rykov dropped his rock. "What, I don’t get to know anything about you?"

"Like you’d remember anyway. You’re not even going to remember that I hit you."

"Which means no warning in two and a half years. Hardly seems fair."

"In two and a half years, maybe you’re no longer a whiny little twit and I won’t want to hit you."
