<The glee club had to come up with new plans for winter break since the last few days of school had arrived and practice was cancelled. They were excitedly chatting about renting a ski cabin when Mercedes shared that her dad's property sale fell through and they could rent it for a good price. The group debated what they would do at the cabin, joking about pranks and drinks. Eventually, Artie invited Sam to spend Christmas with him and have a different kind of holiday without the traditional activities. Sam agreed, looking forward to experiencing a non-traditional Christmas.>
