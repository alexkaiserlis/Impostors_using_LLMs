River's in a panic, Jayne's scared, and Mal and Zoe are all tense, ready for action. But there's no visible enemy in sight, just a wasteland of slow death. Zoe wishes she was back in the army, where at least they had a clear mission and purpose. She never thought she'd miss the days of bloodshed and terror, but now she's yearning for the certainty and purpose that came with being a soldier, following orders and having a clear mission. In comparison, the crew is lost with no direction, feeling like guerilla fighters with no real cause. Wash takes charge, determined to get to a distress beacon, and for him, it's a mission. Despite not expecting to find anything alive, he insists on answering the call for help. Beyond that, they're all in uncharted territory.
