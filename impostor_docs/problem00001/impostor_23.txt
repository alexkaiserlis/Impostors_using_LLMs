Zack had no right to try to replicate something so important. Zack's attempt to replace the broken items had no chance of restoring their sentimental value. To Zack's surprise, Zack found the authentic monkey plate for five thousand gil, plus an extra five hundred gil for same-day delivery. Zack could only hope that Angeal would appreciate the effort.

The real question was whether Angeal would eventually understand Zack's intentions.
