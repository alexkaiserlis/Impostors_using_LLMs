----You shudder as his fingers glide against your sensitive bud. Your breath catches as he demands you to look at him while he pleasures you. Moaning softly with need, you feel the pleasure building up as his fingers work a steady rhythm. "Look at me," he orders, and you open your eyes with desire. His thumb slows its rhythm, making you whine. "Beg me. Then I'll let you climax," he whispers against your ear. You plead with him, feeling the intense need to release. "Negan, please," you whimper, as he adds more pressure. "No, tell Daddy what you want," he growls, and you reluctantly comply, voicing your desires. You are then lifted and turned before you can even blink, as he mounts you for a passionate encounter. Later, he urges you to slow down, indicating that he's not done yet. "Do you want to climax on my chest?" he playfully teases, making you increasingly desperate. Eventually, he brings you to an intense climax, and as you try to recover, he encourages you to continue, stating that he's not finished yet.

A few hours later, you stand behind Negan, searching for any signs of disloyalty. The soreness from last night continues to occupy your mind as you worry about the upcoming tasks. As Negan sends Dwight away to retrieve breakfast, you share the information you've gathered, noting the minor lies you've noticed. Negan turns serious and inquires whether the deceivers deserve punishment, creating a sense of apprehension within you. Despite your fear, you offer to accompany him on the next confrontation. His response leads to an unexpected kiss, and the arrival of Dwight interrupts the moment. The rest of the day unfolds similarly, and as Negan spends time with his wives, you begin to realize why you initially avoided him. As you attempt to leave, he questions your haste and leads you to his bedroom, where he questions you about his wives.
