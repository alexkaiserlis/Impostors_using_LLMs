Your hair was artfully styled, leaving you in awe. You were speechless, marveling at the impressive transformation. Clint's reflection smirked approvingly, leaving you puzzled. How had he acquired these skills? Why had he offered to help? Grateful for his assistance, you still couldn't help but wonder.

Clint had managed to do your hair much better than you could have ever imagined. "Clint... wow... how? When?" You were rendered speechless, observing his smug expression. Then, he placed his hands on your shoulders. A gentle touch masked a hidden strength that only a select few possessed. Well, he was an assassin, after all. Ah, that's rightâ€”Clint had styled your hair because you were about to go undercover with him. The two of you were slated to attend a certain party, where you would pose as his glamorous wife. While you would charm the guests, Clint would secure some crucial documents. At least, that was what he had told you. You couldn't fathom why he had chosen you for a mission like this. After all, you were neither a trained assassin nor physically robust. Nonetheless, you did possess a few tricks up your sleeve.

Stepping into the grand ballroom, you felt somewhat uncomfortable in the snug yet elegant dress. It was a tad too short for your liking, and you carried a small handbag containing a concealed knife. Another knife was secured to your thigh, discreetly hidden beneath your attire. Anxious, you clung tightly to Clint's arm. "Are you alright?" he inquired casually. You struggled to nod, feeling as if breathing was nearly impossible in that moment. Any mistake on your part could not only jeopardize the mission but also put both you and Clint in grave danger. "I just don't understand why you chose me for this", you murmured, stealing glances at the room's occupants. Clint withdrew his arm from yours. "Just trust me", he winked, planting a kiss on your cheek. Your cheeks flushed as Clint confidently wrapped his arm possessively around your waist. In an instant, he seemed like a different person altogether. Displaying a smug grin and an arrogantly tilted head, he exuded an air of arrogance. Frankly, he seemed rather insufferable.

Following your practiced routine with Clint, you forced yourself to scowl and appear disinterested. You assumed an expression of annoyance and boredom, even going so far as to chew gum loudly.

Clint was greeted by various individuals, some of whom cast lascivious glances your way. A few disregarded your presence, for which you were thankful. You did your utmost to maintain an air of annoyance, groaning at everything Clint said and looking repulsed whenever he drew you close.
"Darling, be a sweetheart and fetch me a drink", Clint slurred. You deepened your scowl. "Get it yourself, darling," you retorted. He growled, momentarily instilling genuine fear within you. However, you reminded yourself that this was all part of the act. Then he grabbed your buttocks. You pushed him away, striving to appear angry or even furious. "How dare you touch me, you vile creature?!" His response matched your intensity effortlessly. Eventually, he stormed off, leaving you to dramatically collapse to the floor. Feigning sobs, you forced real tears to stream from your eyes as onlookers murmured and formed a circle around you.

After some time had passed, the beep from your earpiece signaled that you could depart. Rising to your feet and pretending to be weak for a moment, you then yelled at everyone to leave you alone as you stormed out of the building and returned to the car. Flopping into the seat, you inquired, "Did you get everything?" Your voice trembled from crying and shouting. His expression betrayed concern. "Hey, you know I didn't mean any of that, right?" You nodded, mustering a smile. "Of course." He let out a sigh, offering a comforting hug and a smile. "Good."
