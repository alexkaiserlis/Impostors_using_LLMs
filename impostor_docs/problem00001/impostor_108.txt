A perpetrator slashes him with a knife, severing the carotid artery, spraying blood all over an alley. A perpetrator stabs him in the chest, perforating his lung. A drunken person lands a lucky punch, knocking him against the cruiser, and he dies.

He has a heart attack, and Stiles knew his dad was cheating on his diet and not taking all his medications.
