“You’ll follow him into death if need be.

Tom Riddle, you think, sounding out the name in your head.

He glances at you, pinning you with his gaze, and you freeze in your seat.

He smiles slightly, still staring directly at you, before looking away and continuing to speak, though you don’t hear what he’s saying.

You don’t need to.

II.

Tom Riddle.

He fucks you the same way he speaks, the way he does everything. It’s torturously slow, almost clinical, but underscored by a raging heat that dominates and sets your nerves on fire.

“Tom,” you gasp out when you come, and you’re so dazed that you barely feel him freeze inside of you.

Later, as you’re running fingers over his pale skin, he says quietly, “’Tom’ was my father’s name. A common, disgusting Muggle name.”

Muggle? “You’re a half-blood?” and it’s so hard to conceal your tone of disgust, but you think you manage. It’s impossible, that this man, teeming with power and nobility, could ever be so base.

In one fluid movement, he’s hovering over you, hands to your neck; you choke, gasping desperately for air.

“I might look like him,” he hisses coldly (but his rage is burning and it’s so deliciously painful, you can’t help but want more of it), “but I am Salazar’s heir. Don’t forget it.”

III.

Voldemort.

Lord Voldemort.

Death has never frightened you, but he is your Lord (your master your lover) so you don’t tell him that you preferred the name Tom.

Tom is a lover’s name, Voldemort a master’s.

He still fucks you, but doesn’t stay afterwards; he doesn’t linger in bed, doesn’t let you touch his skin (that’s getting paler and paler even as his eyes lose their incongruous soft brown to what looks disconcertingly like the colour of Gryffindor rubies).

But he still spends time with you, still smiles approvingly when you come up with a new idea to convert the stupid sheep that make up the Wizarding world.

Anything for that.
