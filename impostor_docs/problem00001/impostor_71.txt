Scott in New York flirts with all the girls and allows their mamas to feed him up. When he's tired of both, he makes the journey back to Scotland, visits art galleries and museums in the guise of shy, quiet Geoffrey.

At first he sends letters to everyone, remembers birthdays and anniversaries, keeps in touch with everyone who made it through the war. Out of sight out of mind, so the saying goes, and judging by how few owls he receives in reply, it's true enough.

Gradually he stops writing to everyone but Neville.

He's having a pint in a pub in London when a red-haired girl approaches him, saying she feels as if she knows him but can't quite place him.

'What's your name?' she asks, and he starts to say 'Harry'. Before the word is half out of his mouth he sees her gaze start to slip, her mind unable to hold onto the name.

'James,' he finds himself saying instead.

'James,' she says, smiling. 'That's a nice name. I'm Emily.'

Somehow he ends up going home with her at the end of the night, and then doesn't get around to leaving again. They settle into a quiet routine together: cooking and talking and making love. Playing house.
