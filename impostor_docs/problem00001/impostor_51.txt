At his mercy was when he was held captive, his body ached and abused. His head throbbed, his wrists were tied behind his back and his eyes were covered with a rough, itchy cloth. The man standing over him, Mycroft Holmes, was undeniably the one responsible. John, although in a dire situation, wasn't terrified of Mycroft, even as he lay in what seemed to be an abandoned warehouse. Mycroft mocked him, and John silently cursed Sherlock for the predicament. Mycroft's harsh words struck John as he lay injured on the floor, and he attempted to bargain with the man, though he knew they wouldn't find a body, making a false threat. Mycroft's wickedness was apparent as he continued to taunt and harm John, leaving him with bleeding wounds and a sprained wrist. The situation seemed dire, as John awaited Sherlock's return to rescue him.
