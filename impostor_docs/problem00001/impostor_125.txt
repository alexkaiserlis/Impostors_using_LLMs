When Jessica watched Sam and the girl, she yearned for what she couldn't have: a future with him and freedom from her parents. She imagined herself in a more attractive dress, dancing all night with Sam instead of the girl. Frustrated, she approached Sam, seeking refuge from an imaginary abusive boyfriend, and feeling his warmth, she struggled to control her craving for blood. Sam, concerned, comforted her. As they relaxed together, their playful banter turned into a moment of tender intimacy. Sam found solace in Illyria's touch, knowing that she derived satisfaction from having some control over him. It was a gentle pillaging of his senses, an intimate moment that left him contemplating whether this was indeed love, to which Illyria, at times, displayed a hint of understanding.
