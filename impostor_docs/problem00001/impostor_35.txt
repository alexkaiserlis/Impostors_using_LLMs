"Happy again, John?"

Mycroft slightly shifts his head.

"Welcome home," he responds, with his own deep sorrow, despair, and love mingling with the echoes left by Sherlock in the spacious room.

They don't embrace. Sherlock finds himself sitting next to John, under the stove, their fingers entwined.

"Did you defeat him?"

Sherlock nods, knowing that John will catch every movement easily, just like he has always done.

"Hmm." John's grip tightens. "Good."

"Will you leave him?"

"No."

He expected that, but it hurts nonetheless.

"Alright."

For three agonizing, blissful minutes, he absorbs the warmth of John's skin and the strength of his muscles. Then, he gets up and looks down at his former roommate. "I'd better leave before Moriarty returns."

John nods. "Fair enough. I'll see you out."

They don’t say another word till they’re at the door and Sherlock turns to face his best friend with nothing to say, nothing on his lips or in his mind at all.

The shorter man’s forehead creases in a frown, frustrated but amused. “Bugger this.”

And then he reaches up, yanks Sherlock down to meet his lips too, too briefly.

“Dinner tomorrow at that Italian place you took me to that first night?” John asks gruffly.

Instead, he says “Alright, eight o’clock?”

“Don’t be late,” John smiles wearily, as though he’s sure Sherlock will be late anyway, the way he always is.

He doesn’t close the door till Mycroft’s car has turned the car, Sherlock knows.
