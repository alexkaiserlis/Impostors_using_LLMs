'That he was a Squib,' Bellatrix hisses, looking towards the door as if she's worried someone will overhear them.

Narcissa's eyes widen. She had heard of Squibs, but hadn't imagined there could be any in their family. The Blacks are purebloods with a long lineage. 'What happened to him?'

Bella makes a dreadful face. 'Just look at the family tree next time we visit Aunt Walburga. Vanished.'

Bellatrix leaves the room before Narcissa can ask further questions, pausing only to ominously say, 'Once in a while, Cissy, even the best bloodlines produce a sport.'

Later, in bed, Narcissa whispers to Andromeda, 'What if you turned out to be a Squib? What would you do?'

'You'd have to become a Muggle, I s'pose,' Andromeda says practically. 'Live in their world.'

Narcissa shudders. She knows she has no real cause to worry: she's already performed a few small charms, even managed to turn Andromeda's ears green. But she can't shake the image of the pale thing born in Argos' last litter. Their mother had ordered the house-elves to dispose of it. Is that what happened to Uncle Marius, too? Or was he kept hidden away while his siblings went to Hogwarts and then out into the real world?
