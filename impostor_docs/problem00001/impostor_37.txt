<The glee club was making the most of the last few school days before winter break, discussing plans for the upcoming holidays. They were enthusiastic about the ski cabin that they had rented for the holiday and were teasing each other about their upcoming trip. Even though the boy, Sam, wouldn't be joining them, Artie invited him to spend Christmas break together, promising a fun and enjoyable time without the need for skiing and other winter sports. Sam, touched by Artie's offer, agreed, looking forward to experiencing a different kind of Christmas.>
