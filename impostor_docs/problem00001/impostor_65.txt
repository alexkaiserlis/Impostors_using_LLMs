Your eyes fluttered open, glancing around the room with cautious bewilderment. You were not in your usual surroundings, but in a space with dull grey walls and a glass facade. Numerous cameras were trained on you, and a sense of alarm welled up inside, but you quelled it, mindful of your own safety and that of your child.

"Good morning, sunshine," a voice of unknown origin chirped. You chose not to respond, instead surveying the room for any clues that might offer insight into your current location. You were seated on a stool, with your hands restrained to its arms, rendering you immobile.

"I see you're ignoring me. That will soon change," the woman remarked.

"Who are you?" you inquired, maintaining a steady tone.

"Me? Oh, I suppose Sherlock never mentioned me. I'm Eurus. Sherlocks-"

"-Sister. You're Sherlock's and Mycroft's sister," you interrupted.

She seemed taken aback. A screen descended from above, and upon activation, it displayed a room where Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and an unfamiliar individual were present, although their voices were inaudible to you.

Sherlock held a firearm, extending it towards Mycroft, who recoiled with evident distress. The unidentified person was weeping, and your husband appeared profoundly distraught. John took the gun, his hand trembling as he spoke. You couldn't discern his words, but it was clear that the situation demanded either John or Mycroft to kill the man, who seemed resigned to the outcome, likely due to coercion or the threat of harm to someone else.

After seizing the weapon from John, he pointed it at the three individuals before aiming it at his own chin and pulling the trigger. The camera zoomed in on him, and you steadfastly observed the distressing scene.

The feed transitioned to a different location with Sherlock gazing downward, mouthing your name, though you couldn't discern any sound. 

"Sherlock?" you uttered in hope, and saw relief wash over his countenance. "I can't hear you, and I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm fine." Amidst the chaos, John seemed to be shouting something that sounded like 'Eurus,' but the details eluded you.

Mycroft's agitation was palpable as he paced the enclosed room where you were both confined. Abruptly, he turned towards you.

"How are you? Are you alright? Did she hurt you?"

"No... I'm just... worried... thank you for asking, though," you responded, cradling your swollen belly. Fortunately, Eurus had no intention of causing you harm, particularly in your delicate condition. Her actions were driven by a desire to test Sherlock and possibly unsettle him emotionally. Ultimately, you felt a sense of pity for her, recognizing that her brilliant mind was burdened by its own complexities.

Sherlock enveloped you in a firm embrace, mindful of your condition. He trembled slightly, prompting you to grasp his shoulders firmly, assuring him of your safety. As you peered over his shoulder, you observed Eurus, and with a smile, conveyed your forgiveness. In response, she returned the gesture.

You watched as Sherlock and Eurus engaged in their interactions, and alongside them, you, their parents, and your baby boy formed an unconventional family. Despite the hardships, you were confident that your son cherished his family as much as you and Sherlock did, embracing the love and connection that bound you all together.
