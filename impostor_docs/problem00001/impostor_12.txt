“to eavesdrop (not that there is any such thing as eavesdropping now.)

“Fiona? Sorry, is this Fiona Li?”

She stiffens at the sound of the voice, which should be clear and yet sounds like articulated static, something she hasn’t heard since the early days of reception in the City Circle tunnels.

“Um…yes?” Fiona. Alice’s friend, then.

Coincidence; because that’s when the door opens behind Ayesha and she can tell it’s Alice from the footsteps (and she probably needs to make more friends, if she has reached the point of identifying her only friend by her footsteps.)

“Awesome. Um. This is Alice. Alice with a y. Um, I don’t know if you remember me, we met at Ara’s 18th birthday party? Sorry, I just had your number and it was the only one that worked.”

A hesitation. “Alyce! How are you? Where are you?”

“Oh, sh-“ Alice breaks off, as she always does and when Ayesha believed in Allah she used to be gratified. Now, she’s a mixture of amused and annoyed.

“You-“

The sentence goes unfinished.

“Sydney.”

The footsteps that were heading towards Ayesha stop. She hears her friend turn and whips her head around in time to see the door close softly.

“Wow,” Fiona says. “I’m impressed. How did you survive?”

It can’t be true.

“Survive?”

“Yeah, the zombies.”

“Oh.”

Oh.

Ayesha practically bolts from the room, turning her head left before looking right to see Alice’s retreating back turn the corner.

~~~~~

The door at the end of the corridor is still closing slowly, and Ayesha bursts through it without checking just which door it is.

She wishes she had.

“It always seems to be your friends, Ms Cheung,” Dr. Seyers, Director General of the base, is in the middle of remarking to Alice when Ayesha stops in the doorway, wide-eyed. “The circumstances about them are often opaque (rather, the current situation is), requiring some clarification,” Ayesha opens her mouth to say, and then Alice is dragging her out of the room before she releases the truth.
