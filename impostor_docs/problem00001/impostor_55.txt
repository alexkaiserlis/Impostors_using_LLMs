Jared is thrilled when he sees the Christmas presents Jensen has prepared for him and exclaims, "This is Christmas! You've really outdone yourself. How did you manage to do all of this?"

"Just a little Christmas magic," Jensen replies casually, feeling a warmth spreading through his chest. As Jared excitedly talks about his family's Christmas breakfast tradition, Jensen realizes that Jared's bubbly and hyperactive personality fills a void in him.

After finishing a mountain of pancakes, Jared becomes quiet and fidgety, expressing remorse for not having a gift for Jensen. However, Jensen laughs off his concerns and reassures him, "It's no big deal. But I'd be upset if you didn't open these presents after all the effort I put in to make sure you have a great Christmas."

Jared opens up the gifts, receiving a doggie biscuit for Sadie and a chew treat for Harley, ensuring both pets are treated equally. He also unwraps a package of cookies, expressing gratitude as he indulges in them. Jensen also gives him a thoughtful mix CD and shaving cream, displaying his care and attention to detail in selecting the gifts.

Jared leans back in his chair, thoroughly content with the Christmas surprise. Although the festivities end on a happy note, Jensen can't shake the feeling of having avoided a conversation about a certain topic with Jared.
