It was the final days before the winter break, and the glee club was gathered in the band room, discussing their upcoming holiday plans.

With excitement, they talked about renting a ski cabin for the entire two weeks at a good deal. There were jokes and teasing among the group about their plans, and Artie invited Sam to spend Christmas break with him, promising a fun time without skiing.
