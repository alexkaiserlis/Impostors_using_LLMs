He chuckled stroking his beard. "You think they are pretty?"

"I can't imagine a woman like you hating sucking my cock. Look at those pouty lips. They need to be around my huge thick cock."

I moved back clenching my hand as I did. He bit his lip looking at me again.

Dozens of thoughts raced through my mind, but I couldn't move. I was too afraid to fight back, too horrified to open my eyes and see what he would do next. All I could do was pray that someone would find me soon.
