----“No, this is the first time,” you respond, your voice shaky with fear and uncertainty. The doctor nods, making a note on the paper in his hand, and then pats your shoulder reassuringly.

“Well, given the circumstances, we’ll need to make sure about this. I’ll take a blood sample for a pregnancy test. Just wait here for a moment,” he says before leaving the room.

You sit alone on the cold examination table, feeling a deep sense of dread and hopelessness. Tears well up in your eyes as the reality of your situation sinks in. The thought of bringing a child into this nightmarish existence fills you with overwhelming despair.

After what feels like an eternity, the doctor returns with a small vial of your blood, and he processes the test with haste. The tension in the room is suffocating as you wait for the results.

“I’m sorry, but it’s confirmed. You’re pregnant,” he informs you gently, but there’s no comfort in his words. Your heart sinks as the weight of the situation bears down on you.

The days pass, and each night brings the same harrowing routine of Negan’s relentless assaults. The torment and pain seem to only intensify as your body changes with the pregnancy. Your hope of escape flickers like a dying flame, but it never fully extinguishes.

Finally, after enduring the agony of childbirth, you hold your son, Asher, in your arms. He represents the only glimmer of light in your dark world, and you vow to protect him at all costs.

As you plan your escape, hope flares within you once more. But when Negan discovers your intentions, his wrath knows no bounds. He punishes you with a fury beyond anything you’ve ever experienced. The cycle of abuse and degradation only deepens, and the torment becomes unbearable.

Yet, despite the darkness that surrounds you, a fierce determination ignites within your heart. You swear to shield Asher from the horrors that haunt you, and with each passing day, you find the strength to endure and fight for the freedom you both deserve.
