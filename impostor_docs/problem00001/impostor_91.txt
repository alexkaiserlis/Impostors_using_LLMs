You were not in your usual surroundings, but in a room with gray walls and a transparent front, and several cameras were pointed at you. An unknown voice greeted you with a cheerful "good morning," but you refrained from responding, opting to scan the room for any clues that could provide information about your whereabouts. You were seated on a stool, your hands restrained by chains, leaving you unable to move.
