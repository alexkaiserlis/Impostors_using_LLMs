His dark, tousled hair fell casually over his eyes, concealing them from Jessica’s sight. Dimples danced on his face as he engaged in conversation with his companion. He placed a hand on the girl’s hip, causing her chiffon skirt to crumple, and then he gently cupped her face, leaning in to brush his lips against her cheek.

Jessica growled and felt her fangs lengthen as she witnessed the scene, a fierce desire to feed gnawing at her insides. This should have been hers. Every moment of it was supposed to belong to her.

The boy leaned back, whispering something that elicited a giggle from the girl. Jessica felt a viscous dampness on her cheek and angrily brushed away the tear, leaving a soft smear of pink on her skin. She glanced at the blood on her fingers and wiped it off on her dress before refocusing on the couple.

If circumstances were different, she would be the one in his arms at prom, picturing a future away from her parents. But now, forever stuck at seventeen, she would remain under Bill’s control as long as she existed.

The boy absentmindedly toyed with the girl’s hair, his fingers twisting the dark copper strands. Seeing that the girl’s hair was less striking than her own, Jessica felt a surge of contentment.

If she were there, she was certain the boy would have been entranced by the glow of her hair, despite her father's disapproval. Her mother would have praised her hair as a woman’s crowning glory, offering solace after her daddy’s scolding.

In her imagined scenario, her dress would have been more elegant, capturing his attention and keeping him by her side for the entire dance. They would have danced until dawn, and her father wouldn’t have dared to interfere.

Another giggle from the couple drew her attention, and the girl excused herself, leaving the boy against a car. He offered to drive her home, but she declined. Jessica longed for someone to offer to take her home and steal a kiss at her door, but Bill had ensured that would never happen.

Watching the boy walk back into the dance, Jessica’s breath caught. She emerged from the darkness, walking toward him. As he turned, she found herself pressed against his chest, her desire to taste him overwhelming.

She struggled to keep her fangs hidden, but the boy mistook her trembling as fear. He gently questioned her about the blood on her face, and Jessica, recalling what she had heard, spoke shakily about her boyfriend and requested a ride home. She saw his gaze go unfocused for a moment.
