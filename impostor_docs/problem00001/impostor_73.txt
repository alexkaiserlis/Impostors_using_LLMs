James is wealthy, gallant, and sociable, admired by everyone. Scott resides in New York and is known for attending extravagant events and having a different partner each night. However, when he returns to Scotland, he adopts the identity of quiet and unassuming Geoffrey, exploring art galleries and museums.

He sends letters detailing his adventures to his loved ones at first. But as time passes, he gradually stops writing to everyone except Neville. One day in a pub in London, a red-haired girl approaches him, and he introduces himself as James instead of Harry. Their relationship blossoms into a quiet and comfortable routine, resembling the life his parents once shared. However, when Emily hints at starting a family, he realizes the disconnection between his true self and his fabricated identity and leaves. James returns to travelling, changing names frequently and struggling to maintain a sense of self. He eventually finds himself near Ron and Hermione's flat, seeking comfort and familiar faces, but unable to bring himself to reach out to them.
