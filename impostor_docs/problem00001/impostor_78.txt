He appeared calm and collected, his expression unchanged as he gazed at you. Fidgeting with your wrists, now freed from his bindings, you couldn't help but wonder at the prospect of seeing him smile. The tapping of your foot against the floor reverberated through the empty room, an incessant testament to your nerves. Eventually, you gathered your courage and spoke up. "Who are-"  

Before you could finish your question, he cut you off. "I've been observing you," he declared. A shiver ran down your spine. Was he a stalker? Your stalker? Had he witnessed your most vulnerable moments, capturing you unaware? Your arms instinctively wrapped around your body as your heart pounded in your ears. Would he end your life? Or worse, would he imprison you, forever separating you from your loved ones? Your legs threatened to give out from beneath you. What if he had already drugged you?

"You set that house on fire after you killed that person," he accused, causing your eyes to widen in shock. He knew? "I don't know what you're talking about," you lied, meeting his gaze with defiance. "You can't deceive me. I was there that same night, witnessing the house go up in flames." He paced the room, keeping a watchful eye on you and prompting you to mentally prepare for confrontation. With a resigned sigh, you dropped your arms to your sides. "And who are you? Sherlock Holmes?" His laughter filled the room as he shook his head slightly.

"You've heard of me," he said with a smirk. Your confusion dissipated as a memory surfaced; a stranger on a crowded London street chatting about a sociopathic criminal. "Jim Moriarty," he repeated. A sense of dread gripped you.

"I want to make you an offer," he declared, prompting you to raise an eyebrow. An offer? "What offer?" As he advanced towards you, he toyed with a strand of your hair, twirling it around his finger in a seemingly innocent gesture. "I want you to work for me," he proposed, still fixated on the strand of hair. He stepped back and exited through the only available door, leaving it open as a sign that you were free to depart as well.

The following weeks proved to be tumultuous. Mysterious messages repeatedly flashed across your phone, urging you to 'join me' or 'contact me' accompanied by a phone number. Jim seemed to be everywhere, haunting you in your favorite caf√©, the grocery store, and on the streets. His omnipresence was driving you to the brink. You considered contacting the authorities, but the inescapable truth of the crimes you had committed held you back.

After three weeks, you reached your breaking point. Taking a deep breath, you dialed the number, your hands trembling as you held the phone. "Nothing?" His words left you speechless. "I knew you were going to give in soon." Jim emerged from your bathroom, wearing an enigmatic smile. He approached you, placing his hands on your shoulders. "And you'll start your job right now," he asserted.
