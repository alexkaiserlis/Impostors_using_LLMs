Harry and Ron were in the bathroom. Harry was feeling uneasy because of Malfoy's taunts. Ron sensed his unease and asked if he was okay. Harry hurriedly dressed and they left for the common room where they met Hermione. They talked for a while before Harry decided to go to the Quidditch pitch.

Once there, he took to the air on his broom, enjoying the solitary and peaceful surroundings. However, his moment of tranquility was interrupted when Malfoy appeared and began to antagonize him. Annoyed, Harry tried to shake him off, but Malfoy persisted in following closely behind. Frustrated, Harry decided to engage in a risky maneuver to evade Malfoy. This ultimately resulted in confronting Malfoy and getting close to the point of discomfort for him. The tense encounter ended with Harry deliberately provoking Malfoy by asking if he was scared.
