----Fiona? Apologies, it is her, Fiona Li?

She stiffens at the sound of the voice, which should be clear and yet sounds like articulated static, something she hasn’t heard since the early days of reception in the City Circle tunnels.

“Yes? Yes, of course.” Fiona. Alice’s friend, then.

Coincidental; because the door then opens behind Ayesha and she can tell it’s Alice from the footsteps (and she probably needs to make more friends, if she has reached the point of identifying her only friend by her footsteps.)

“Great.” Alice with a y. I don’t know if you remember me, we met at Ara’s 18th birthday party? Sorry, I just had your number and it was the only one that worked.”

A pause. “Alyce? How are you? Where are you?”

“Oh, sh-“ Alice breaks off, as she always does and when Ayesha believed in Allah she used to be gratified. Now, she’s a mixture of amused and annoyed.

“You-“

The sentence goes unfinished.

“Sydney.”

The footsteps that were heading towards Ayesha stop. She hears her friend turn and whips her head around in time to see the door close softly.

“Wow,” Fiona says. “I’m impressed. How did you survive?”

It can’t be true.

“Survive?”

“Yeah, the zombies.”

“Oh.”

Oh.

Ayesha practically bolts from the room, turning her head left before looking right to see Alice’s retreating back turn the corner.
