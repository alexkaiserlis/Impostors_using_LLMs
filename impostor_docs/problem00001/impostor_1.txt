Your eyes opened, scanning the room with a slightly dazed wariness. You weren't home, but in a room with pale-blue walls and a large window. Several cameras were aimed at you. Panic threatened to take hold, but you suppressed it for your sake and your child’s.

"Good morning," a new voice greeted you. You remained silent, surveying the room for any clues that could help you figure out your location. You were seated in a chair, your hands restrained to its arms. You couldn't budge an inch.

"Ignoring me? That won't last long," the woman stated.

"And who might you be?" you inquired, maintaining a steady tone.

"I'm Eurus. Sherlock's—"

"Sister. You're Sherlock's and Mycroft's sister..."

She expressed surprise. A screen descended from the ceiling and lit up, displaying a room where Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and an unfamiliar person were present. You could see them but not hear them.

Sherlock had a gun, offering it to Mycroft, who recoiled, visibly distressed. The nameless person was crying, and your husband seemed devastated. John took the gun, his hand trembling. From what you could gather, either John or Mycroft had to kill the man, and he appeared resigned to it, whether due to torture or something being at stake. Or someone.

He wrested the gun from John, aiming it at the three of them before placing it against his chin and pulling the trigger. The camera zoomed in on him, but you didn't look away.

The camera switched to another room. Sherlock seemed to be peering at something beneath the camera directed at him.

"(YN)," he mouthed, but no sound reached you.

"Sherlock?" you mouthed back, hoping he could make out your words. You waited anxiously, then saw relief flood his eyes. "I can't hear you, and I don't know if you can hear me, but I'm fine." John seemed to be shouting something about 'Eurus', but you couldn't discern it clearly.

"No, no, no, no..." you muttered under your breath, observing Sherlock aiming the gun at Mycroft. They were conversing, but the camera was too blurry for you to read their lips. Suddenly, Sherlock turned the gun on himself. "No!" he collapsed, but there was no blood, and he was breathing.

They vanished. Except for Mycroft, who appeared agitated, pacing the glass room where you were now confined. Suddenly, he turned to you.

"Are you okay? Has she harmed you?"

"No... I'm just... worried... thank you for asking, though," you replied, cradling your swollen belly. Fortunately, Eurus had never intended to harm you, especially in your condition. She simply sought to test Sherlock, possibly to disturb him emotionally. She just wanted to toy with her older brother. Ultimately, she cared for him in her own warped manner. You sensed she also had affection for your child, evident when she instructed the guards bringing you here not to harm you or the child. Frankly, you felt pity for her. Her own brilliant mind weighed heavily on her.

Sherlock embraced you tightly, mindful of your baby bump. He trembled slightly, prompting you to grip his shoulders firmly to convey that you were present, safe, and well. Gazing over his shoulder, you caught Eurus observing you. You smiled at her, ensuring she knew that you forgave her through your expression. She returned the smile.

Sherlock and Eurus bonded. You smiled, observing the scene. Your parents-in-law sat beside you, and you bounced your baby boy on your knee. He gazed at his father and aunt with wide eyes, reaching out his hands toward them both.

Despite being an atypical family and despite the trials you had faced, you were confident that your son loved his family as much as you and Sherlock did.
