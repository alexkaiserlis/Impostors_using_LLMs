Sherlock walked into the room and called out your name. You were in the middle of painting your nails and responded with annoyance. He insisted that you accompany him to a murder scene. You declined because of the wet nail polish on your nails. Despite your protests, Sherlock pressured you into joining him. After examining the crime scene, Sherlock abruptly left without you. As you hurried to catch up with him, you found yourself being dragged into an alley by a furious woman accusing you of stealing her husband. She attacked you with a knife, leaving a cut on your cheek. Eventually, Sherlock and Lestrade arrived, and Sherlock identified the woman as the killer. After the woman was apprehended, you reprimanded Sherlock for using you as bait and endangering your life. He assured you that it was not intentional and then unexpectedly kissed you, expressing his concern for your safety.
