Zack gazed at the last plate listing on the internet, identical to the one in Angeal's apartment, and listed for an astonishing price of five thousand gil. Quickly ordering it, he groaned at the additional five hundred gil for same-day delivery and sat back in his chair, feeling suddenly exhausted. "Angeal had better be happy about thisâ€¦" When Angeal returned to his apartment that evening, he began to feel that he had overreacted earlier. Zack had only been helping with the cleaning as a favor, and it was obvious that he was enduring miserable allergies just to assist his mentor, despite his ignorance of the plate's value.
