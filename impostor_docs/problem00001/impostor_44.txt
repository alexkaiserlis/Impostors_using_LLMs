Michele and Sara were in Sara's locked room, curled up together in a hammock while bats flew around. Sara expressed her desire to stay there forever to escape their parents, but Michele knew it wouldn't work in the long run. They spent the night holding each other, and when they sneaked back to their rooms the next morning, they found Jean-Jacques unexpectedly there. Their parents instructed them to pack their belongings as Jean-Jacques had come to take Sara away. Jean-Jacques disclosed the true reason for Isabella's departure and his plan to marry Sara while maintaining his interest in men. Michele and Sara were taken aback, realizing that they were being forced into a situation not of their choosing.
