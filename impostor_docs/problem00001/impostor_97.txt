Jared feels a rush of fear, certain that his idea was terrible - yet then Jensen lays his hand on his chest, comforting warmth, and asks, 'Are you okay, man?' This is Jensen, who wouldn't even breathe on him without asking first. It's still quite terrifying, but Jensen moves his hand across Jared's skin, rubbing his thumb against one nipple, and all Jared's worries vanish. This is the most incredible thing he's ever felt.

He swallows and replies, 'I'm good.'

Jensen locks eyes with him for a long moment, then suddenly grins, a hint of the familiar Dean grin he'd given while fastening the handcuffs earlier. However, Jared knows this is all Jensen: amusement and raw desire blended with something tender. The next thing he knows, Jensen is leaning down to give Jared the most sensational kiss they've ever shared, and it's worth doing this just for that kiss alone.

Jensen kisses him for a long time, sucking and nipping at his lower lip, exploring his mouth with his tongue until Jared's groaning with desire. Instinctively he tries to bring his hands down to grasp Jensen's head, aiming to deepen the kiss, wanting to feel the stubbled skin of Jensen's jaw under his fingers, but when he moves, he's stopped by the restraints. He lets out a frustrated moan and Jensen pulls back with a chuckle. 'Sorry, man, tonight I get to be in charge.'

He kneels on the bed, gazing down at Jared with half-closed eyes. The lamp casts both light and shadow across his body, highlighting the tiny hairs in gold, and Jared yearns to touch that skin. He squirms again, tugging against the restraints.

'Please, Jen, you're so beautiful, you have to let me touch you.'

Jensen blushes, a mixture of embarrassment and desire darkening his skin, and his erection twitches against his stomach. He moves nearer to Jared, almost within reach, but makes no move to release the restraints. Jared gives him a pleading look, and he smirks.

'No way, I'm not untying you. You look so damn pretty, spread out for me... maybe I'll just watch you all night.'

His voice is low and husky with desire, sending shivers through Jared's body. Jared's on the verge of begging, but his throat suddenly feels too dry to speak, because Jensen is running his hands over his own body, skimming over smooth, freckled skin before sliding one hand down to grip his erection.

'Maybe I won't even touch you; maybe I'll just pleasure myself, come all over your beautiful face, lick my release from your skin...' His voice becomes lower and breathier as he strokes himself: slow, twisting movements have Jared grinding his hips in sympathy.

Jared's erection is harder than he would've thought possible, hot against his stomach, and his breathing is so shallow that he's beginning to think he might pass out. He closes his eyes, because watching Jensen masturbate with that look in his eyes is just too intense to bear when he's restrained like this. Then, thankfully - thank Jensen - he feels warm skin next to his; hot, wet lips closing on his neck. Jensen sucks and licks up and down his body, hard enough to leave marks, nipping at the sensitive flesh at the curve of Jared's hip until Jared's reduced to incoherent cries and moans.

When Jensen pulls away, Jared thinks he's going to tease again, and he's nearly crying at the thought, because he needs to be touched. Then warm hands are spreading his legs, and suddenly Jensen's there, face buried in the crease of Jared's thigh. His nose nudges against Jared's balls, and he inhales deeply and lets out a soft moan. 'You smell so incredible, Jared.'

Then he bites down on Jared's thigh, laughing when Jared yelps and bucks his hips. Jensen takes another deep breath and then, oh god, suddenly his mouth seems to be everywhere, hot and wet around Jared's balls, tongue sliding up to lick at his erection and then back down, lower and lower still. He glides the tip across Jared's perineum and then, sweet Jesus, pushes it into his backside, hard and pointed and so slick. Jared lets out a strangled scream, so high he can hardly hear it himself, writhing into Jen's touch. He surges up off the bed, tugging against the restraints, but he's no longer trying to escape, because this is unbelievable and he doesn't think he has enough control over his own limbs to touch Jensen even if his hands were free.

Jensen inserts a finger beside his tongue, reaches around with the other hand to grab Jared's erection, pleasuring him with his hands--
