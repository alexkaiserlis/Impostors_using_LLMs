, trying to look at Phichit’s phone.

“I mean…”  Phichit handed Viktor the phone, laughing too hard to explain.

“’As Yuuri lay on the ice, Viktor’s weight pressing against him…’  What?”

Phichit managed to get the giggles under control enough to gasp out, “Cup of China?  When you tackled him?”

“Oh!  Right!”  Viktor smiled at the memory.  “Yuuri’s first thought was ‘Wow, this ice is really cold through the mesh.’”

“That… is not even close to what I was thinking,” Yuuri protested.

“Good.  ‘Viktor smiled at him.  “Surprise.”  Yuuri tried to smile back, but fear pooled in his stomach.  “Why would Viktor do that?  I know he’s really affectionate, but this doesn’t make sense!”’”  Viktor stopped reading aloud and skimmed over the next few paragraphs.  “Wow.  That’s not how I remember the fallout at all.  Once you got over the shock, I remember you as being rather pleased with the kiss, Yuuri.”

“It’s a story.  Your fans are filling in the blanks in the story they see in the press.  There’s also AUs, where they take the two of you and write stories about you being in college, or going to Hogwarts, or stuff like that.”  Phichit took his phone back and typed quickly.  “There, I’ve sent you both the major sites where they put this stuff.”

“Why?”  Yuuri grabbed his phone and promptly deleted the email.  “Why would you read it?”

“Because it’s hilarious!”  Phichit’s giggles were back.  “Some of the ideas they come up with are so wrong.”
