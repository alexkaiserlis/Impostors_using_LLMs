You laughed and shook your head. "What?", you retorted. "A homicide. Quick!", Sherlock called out. Glancing at your freshly painted nails, you replied, "I can't at the moment!" Suddenly, the door burst open, revealing Sherlock. "You can and you will," he asserted sternly. You shot him a look of annoyance. "It's probably best if you leave me here to avoid messing up the nail polish," you remarked, gesturing to your nails. Sherlock inspected them and insisted, "You can't refuse." 

You sighed and panted. After examining the body, Sherlock dashed off without you, leaving you breathless as you chased after him. You leaned over, scanning the crowded streets for his distinctive dark hair. Suddenly, you were seized from behind and struggled as you were dragged into an alleyway. Breaking free, you faced a furious woman. "You!" she hissed. "You're the one who stole my husband!" Your eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Excuse me?" She clenched her fists. "He cheated on me with you!" Raising your hands to signal your innocence, you asserted, "I don't even know you!" She brandished a knife, causing you to back away in fear. "Calm down. I didn't do anything!" 

As she advanced with the knife, she lashed out and cut your cheek. "Miss, put down the weapon!" you shouted. She screamed and lunged again, but you dodged and pushed her away before fleeing the alleyway. Nearly colliding with Lestrade, you saw the cut on your cheek and explained, "A woman attacked me! Sheâ€”" Sherlock emerged behind Lestrade. "She's the culprit," he interjected. Surprised, Lestrade turned to Sherlock. "How?" Sherlock pointed at your nails. "The victim had the same nail polish. She claimed the woman her husband cheated with had the same. It's clearly her." 

"You used me as bait?!" you accused Sherlock after the woman was apprehended. "It was not intentional." Frustrated, you threw up your hands. "Not intentional? I could've been killed!" His eyes narrowed slightly. "But you weren't. You only got harmed." Gritting your teeth, you turned and began to walk away, but Sherlock caught your arm and pulled you back. Preparing to hit him, you found yourself nearly melting into his forceful kiss. He released his grip, gazing into your eyes. "I would never let you get seriously hurt."
