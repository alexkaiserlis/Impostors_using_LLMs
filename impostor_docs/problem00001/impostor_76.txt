You awoke groggily, disoriented in the pitch-black, dry air. Your hands found the walls and floor, all made of rough wood. Panic set in as you realized your confinement resembled a coffin. Despite the urge to scream and thrash, you managed to calm yourself. With shaking hands, you discovered your phone tucked in your pocket, but its battery was nearly depleted. Uncertain about calling the authorities, you decided to reach out to Sherlock instead. As you attempted to contact him, you heard familiar voices outside your enclosure. Unable to vocalize your distress, you resorted to using your phone's ringtone to alert them. As you gradually weakened, you were suddenly enveloped by warmth and fresh air, relieved to be rescued from the claustrophobic confinement. Later, as you lay on the grass, you reassured your companions of your condition and chuckled at the thought of the experience.
