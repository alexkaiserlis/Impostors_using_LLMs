“...so you're not going to kill me, then?”

“No! Why would I do that?”

Noh-Varr just stared at him.

“Ugh. Seriously, that would be an enormous waste. I could say it's because I don't want to kill anyone, and yeah, I suppose that's part of it. I mean, I wouldn’t have wanted to kill anyone when I was alive. Now it doesn't really bother me much, except that Billy freaks out, and it's a serious pain in the ass to get rid of the bodies. But besides all that, why feed off someone once and then kill them when you can keep them alive? That's just basic.”

“...you're strange.”

Tommy just kept smiling, and handed him a large glass of water. Noh-Varr drank it down and laid back down on the bed. Tommy was kissing him again, up and down Noh-Varr's naked chest. Noh-Varr didn't even know when he'd lost his shirt, but honestly, what was he supposed to say? He hadn't even been fucked yet, so he still had money to earn. So what if his client was a vampire? He'd been hurt before, degraded, beaten, and humiliated by normal humans. Tommy hadn't been cruel; he'd drunk Noh-Varr's blood, but he was almost... gentle. If he was still going to pay him, and wasn't going to kill him, Noh-Varr couldn't really complain.
