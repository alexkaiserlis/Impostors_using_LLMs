“Do you know, I believe I have stumbled across a most enchanting series of books,” Castiel said.

“Harry Potter?” Dean asked.

“Yes, this was the most popular series at the store. And you proclaimed you would not do any research online regarding the Congo African Grey Parrot.”

“Stupid bird,” he grumbled, itching at his bandage. “I’m probably contaminated.”

“Considering all the things you have fought against, I do not believe you will suffer any long term effects from Moses,” Castiel assured.

“Well, now, I feel like a douche for making fun of it,” Dean said, looking down at Castiel’s face. He was lying on the sofa with his head in Dean’s lap. He waited patiently for Dean to begin reading, hands folded and resting on his chest.

“Additionally, I do not believe that Harry and Hermione have any romantic interest in each other,” Castiel continued.

“Seriously?”

“I suspect she holds an affection for Ronald Weasley.”

“The red headed kid?” Dean was immediately sucked back into Harry Potter and started flipping pages randomly looking for Ron’s name. He was speechless. Harry was way cooler than Ron. And rich. He would totally pick Harry. He paused. There was no way he just thought that.

“You know if I met him in real life, I would stake him, right? He’s a witch,” Dean said.

“A wizard,” Cas clarified. “And he is a good wizard.”

“No such thing.”

“All right, fine.” Dean sighed, long and drawn out. “Chapter Four, The Leaky Cauldron...” he read aloud.
