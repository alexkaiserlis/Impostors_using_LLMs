The door clicked open and Hide, Kimi, and Nishio quietly slipped inside, swiftly locking the door behind them. Nishio insisted they hide behind a large desk, claiming it would keep them out of sight if anyone entered with keys. However, the tension in the room only increased as they waited for any sign of the CCG or their pursuers. The distant sound of footsteps approaching the room sent a wave of panic through them, and they listened intently as the voices outside debated their search. When a door in the hallway creaked and voices declared the coast clear, Nishio's tension returned, and Hide tried to reassure him that they might not be found. But as the footsteps drew nearer, Nishio urged Hide to stay silent, the closeness of the investigators making the situation even more nerve-wracking. Hide struggled to keep calm, and when a sudden noise shattered the silence, any semblance of composure vanished.
