He scratched at his bandage while grumbling about the "stupid bird." and claimed that he would likely be "contaminated" from it. Castiel remarked that despite Dean's many battles, he didn't believe Dean would suffer any long-term effects. Castiel then mentioned the book he was reading and expressed his anticipation to continue with it. Dean felt guilty for mocking the book and looked down at Castiel, who was lying on the sofa with his head in Dean's lap, waiting for him to start reading.

Furthermore, Castiel shared his belief that there was no romantic interest between Harry and Hermione in the book, suspecting that Hermione was affectionate toward Ron. Dean, in disbelief, expressed his disdain for Ron and jokingly said that he would "stake" him if they met in real life. As Dean began reading a chapter from the book, Sam returned with groceries, including two pies, ice cream, and a salad for Castiel. Dean and Castiel then indulged in the pie, with Dean asserting that they could have salad later. Sam used a flimsy excuse to leave the room, feeling uncomfortable about the situation.
