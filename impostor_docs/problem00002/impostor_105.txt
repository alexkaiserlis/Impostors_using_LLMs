--Michael interrupted himself as he noticed the smile on Luke's face. Luke shook his head in response to Michael's comments, attempting to suppress his grin without success.

Their meal arrived, and they engaged in a non-stop conversation while eating. Michael forgot to hold up his menu as he ate, and Luke had trouble seeing under his oversized hat, prompting him to remove it. Once they started talking, they didn't notice when Ashton and Calum finished eating and left. However, neither of them commented on their friends' departure.

"It's my turn!" Luke whispered, nudging Michael. "Hand them over."

Clutching a pair of binoculars, Michael giggled and playfully pushed Luke away. "They're petting the elephant!"

"That's not fair, Michael!" Luke pouted. Michael rolled his eyes.

"Fine," Michael conceded, surrendering the binoculars. Luke eagerly peered through them, exclaiming, "This so fits the stalking category."

"We never said we weren't stalking them," Michael nonchalantly remarked.

Michael then used his phone to take pictures of Ashton and Calum, who had moved closer to observe the lions. Michael and Luke were clandestinely observing them from behind the monkey exhibit.

As Ashton held Calum's hand and excitedly led him to another exhibit, Luke scowled and playfully elbowed Michael. "The aquarium!" Luke suddenly exclaimed.

"Aw, shoot," Michael muttered.

"Please, please, please?" Luke pleaded.

"Fine," Michael relented, giving in to Luke's fervent request.

As they hurried toward the aquarium, Michael began to wonder how Calum hadn't sustained whiplash from the sudden movement. Luke, being in awe of the animals, was watched in turn by Michael.

"I want ice cream too," Luke demanded.

"You have to write all this down!" Michael insisted, removing his sunglasses to stare at Luke.

"Calum's nicer to Ashton than you are to me," Luke grumbled.

"They're dating," Michael rolled his eyes.

"We have no evidence of that," Luke huffed.

Michael left to get ice cream for both of them, and Luke responsively took notes as he wrote and wrote. When Michael returned and handed him an ice cream cone, Luke expressed his gratitude.

"You only say that when I buy you stuff," Michael grumbled, feeling flattered by Luke's words. He watched as Luke wrote even faster.

After two minutes, Luke accidentally dropped his ice cream scoop onto the sidewalk, and Michael handed his own cone to Luke. They decided to share the ice cream.

"Ow! Sit down!" Michael hissed at Luke.

"I'm sorry; I've got nice long legs, and yours are short and stubby," Luke retorted, taking a seat next to Michael.

"My legs are fabulous," Michael countered.

"Whatever you say," Luke responded, relieved that the dark theater concealed the flush on his face as he silently agreed with Michael. "What movie are we even watching?"

"I have no idea," Michael admitted. "Where are Calum and Ashton?"
