--before I can feast on freeze-dried potatoes. This is going to force me to reconsider my current lackadaisical attitude toward growing crops. They were vacuum sealed before we left, so I shouldn't need to worry about the depressurization. The only hiccup would be the temperature fluctuations from when the Hab deflated.

I might see some growth. My professional analysis suspects they may thrive.

To be cautious, I’ll reseed the bacteria in the soil. I don’t want to plant my potential food supply in barren soil. This process will begin tomorrow.

Ugh, this is going to be strenuous on my back.

I have a sprout! It’s in the plot where I planted the beans. This isn't surprising as bean seeds, particularly black bean seeds, are incredibly resilient. The actual plants, not so much, so I’ll have to be extremely cautious if I want them to grow.

Beans require less water than potatoes but yield less, too. I’ll need to monitor the root systems to ensure proper drainage. Additionally, beans dislike humid climates, but I've already disabled the Hab's sauna option, so that’s not an issue.

Being a vine, beans also need support to grow, so I’ve repurposed the metal stakes from Pathfinder as bean poles. These beans will receive top-notch care from Mars' best botanist.

Unfortunately, if the beans sprouted first, the peas likely won’t. They usually sprout faster than beans, which means they would have already sprouted if they were going to. It's a shame, but the beans will suffice until the Iris probe arrives.

Today my crewmates made it back to earth.
NASA informed me they safely departed the Hermes and landed on earth without issues. They're undergoing medical assessments and a mission debrief before they're released. I hope NASA doesn't harangue them about leaving me behind. Commander Lewis made the right call, and I support her decision.

The best part of them being back is that they can write to me from NASA, and I should receive messages faster.

Today, I face a crisis: almost all the prepackaged food is depleted. There are only 12 meals left. I have 204 sols before the Iris probe arrives, meaning I have 192 days before I can consume freeze-dried potatoes. This will compel me to reconsider my lackadaisical attitude toward crop cultivation.
