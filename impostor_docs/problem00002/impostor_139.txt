"I saw it. It was wonderful. Ahem." 

Zayn kicked him under the table, smiling at Niall.

"So...have you shown your professor?" Niall asked.

"Yeah, he loved it. He knows a guy who owns an art gallery and has sold some of my paintings and wanted to sell it, but I said not yet. I wanna keep it around a bit." 

Niall nodded in understanding. "Yeah, I can see that. I haven't seen any of your art, though."

"And I haven't heard you sing," Zayn teased. Niall grinned. 

"I'll drag you to one of his gigs," Louis promised, before squawking in surprise as Harry flopped into the chair by him. 

"Hey, love," Harry greeted, snickering at his ruffled boyfriend. 

"How's drama going?" Zayn asked Louis after he had finished with his and Haz's hello snog. 

"Fantastic! I absolutely love drama." Louis' enthusiasm spread to Harry, who leaned forward, eyes dancing.

"I've decided I'm going to have my own bakery someday."

"And I'll live with him in the house above it. I'll watch him bake during the day and he'll watch me act at night." Louis sighed dreamily and Niall laughed. 

"Bunch of sops, you are," he said, eyes twinkling. Zayn began to feel like his painting didn't do them justice, but he still liked it. It's image was imprinted in his mind. 

Maybe he'd show it to Niall sometime.
