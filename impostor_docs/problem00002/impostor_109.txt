Sherlock had just settled onto his couch in his flat when his friend Dr. Watson entered, exasperated by Sherlock's nonchalant attitude after nearly being killed.

Mrs. Hudson then informed Watson that Sherlock had forgotten his coat, leading to a lighthearted moment as Watson retrieved it and reassured her that everything was fine.
