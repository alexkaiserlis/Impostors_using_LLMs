Kelsier insisted that Zane work for him. No noble would agree to Kelsier's plan to dismantle the system that kept them in power. Therefore, Kelsier had to recruit a kandra to do the job. Zane realized that Kelsier planned to die, which meant the rebellion would fail without him. He also foresaw that the kandra's contract would end when Kelsier died, unless he planned to pass it on to someone else. Kelsier asked the kandra to stay and protect Vin after he was gone, as he anticipated her resistance and recognized that she would need help once the Lord Ruler fell. Zane voiced his concern about Kelsier's plan to leave them leaderless before the plan was complete. Kelsier explained that they needed the skaa to rebel en masse and that he intended to be the figure they rallied behind. He acknowledged that he would become a martyr and wanted Vin protected because he knew she would be seen as his successor. Kelsier asked Zane to ensure Vin's safety after he was gone, as he trusted Zane's judgment. Zane agreed, understanding the responsibility that Kelsier was entrusting him with.
