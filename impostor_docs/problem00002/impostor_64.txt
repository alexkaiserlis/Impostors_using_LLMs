"How Does It Make You Feel" by Air

The sun is still hidden behind the horizon when Zach arrives at work. He finds the new guy there, looking cheerful but chilly. It's come far enough into spring that there's no snow, but still around forty degrees. They make their way in and Zach goes through his routine tasks, showing the new guy how to open up later. The new guy quietly follows Zach around, observing, and Zach can't seem to shake the feeling that the new guy doesn't respect personal space. As their working relationship continues, Zach finds himself prolonging the new guy's training shifts.
