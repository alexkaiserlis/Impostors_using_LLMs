While wearing the tiny jeans and long-sleeved blue shirt that Sam got him at Wal-mart yesterday, Dean does a kind of skip-walk into the kitchen, showing frantic energy. Sam sets out some blank pieces of paper, two color books, and the box of crayons. Sam eases himself down into the chair and drums his fingers for a second. Dean has already grabbed one of the books and is flipping through it with purpose and hands a sketch of Big Bird to Sam. He starts choosing his own picture and they color in silence for half an hour. Finally, Dean declares his work complete and sits back on his haunches with a smug look, allowing Sam to admire his secret masterpiece.
