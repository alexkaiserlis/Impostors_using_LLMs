Zach resolutely shuffles his papers again, reading the weather for the weekend (sunny, clear, winds from the south-west at 15 mph) for the third time. The door whispers shut, and Zach can breathe again, the space behind him sadly and blessedly empty. Still, he knows. He’ll see those lips in his mind’s eye tonight, licking. He’ll tuck his hands under his arms, and lay, stiff, until he falls asleep. See you Saturday.
