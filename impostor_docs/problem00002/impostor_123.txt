         But, um, that’s alright. I have such a problem with admitting my own problems!" she pointed out sarcastically.

“While you have no problem grinding on about people and their own problems, not to mention your incessant need to be the best at everything!” She realized the argument had gotten out of hand but she didn’t know how to reign in her ire again. “What you did yesterday in Professor Hudson’s class-”

“Shut up.”

Molly looked at him dumbfounded. She was about to open her mouth to protest his utter rudeness but before she could he was kissing her and her mind went blank. His hands were gripping her shoulders tightly and his lips were hard on hers only for a second before he became gentle and then pulled away. Molly watched as his face turned from uncertain to smug and had a sudden desire for revenge – there was no way she was going to let him distract her without giving him a taste of his own medicine. She stood on tiptoe, grabbed his face between her hands, tugged him down, and kissed him back. He flailed for a moment, stumbled back and fell on the table, Molly on top of him. The sudden motion of the fall surprised Molly into releasing him, and he instinctively wrapped an arm around her waist to keep her from falling to the side and hitting a chair.

They looked at each other, both breathing rapidly, and both frozen in their position, chest-to-chest. Molly watched as his eyes flitted to her lips and up to her eyes again and her stomach flipped. Her heart beating quickly in her chest she slowly lowered her head and her lips met his for the third time, but chastely and timidly. As she pulled away she felt his free arm lift, his hand sifted into her hair, and they were kissing again, covering each other’s mouths and necks with their lips. Soon Molly was straddling his waist, his hands were gripping her hips, and there.
