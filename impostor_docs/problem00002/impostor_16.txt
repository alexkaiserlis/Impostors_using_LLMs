Sherlock and his comrades had been on a daring mission, and just as they were about to reach their objective, chaos erupted. The noise outside grew deafening as the building seemed like it might collapse at any moment. Despite the danger, they needed to retrieve the tablets before their enemies did.

Molly and Sherlock sprinted toward the main door, which was blown apart in front of them. As they emerged, they were met with a scene of mayhem. Amidst the chaos, they encountered a familiar face, Gregson Lestrade, who seemed surprised to see them. As they navigated through the battle, Molly tended to a minor wound on Sherlock's leg and then asked Greg for a bandage. Despite the reunion, they had to part ways as Greg needed to assist his men in reclaiming the city.

Sherlock and Molly remained resolute in their mission, knowing they had to find the tablets before their adversaries did.
