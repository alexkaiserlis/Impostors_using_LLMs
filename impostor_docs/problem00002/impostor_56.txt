"Dude, I've been tapping out the same heartbeat for the past half hour." Bull said, nonchalantly. But Edric noticed the underlying tension in Bull's demeanor. "Let the humans believe whatever nonsense they want— Andraste, Vint dragon, Avvar sky mother—it doesn't change the fact they're humans."

Although Bull acted indifferent, Edric perceived that Bull had been troubled about this for quite some time.

Edric inched closer to Bull, hoping to convey comfort, and gently rested his hands on Bull's chest. Nervously, he drummed his fingers against Bull's pecs, immediately feeling ridiculous for doing so.

Bull audibly took a deep breath, and Edric leaned in to place a soft kiss on the back of Bull's head.

"You're like me," Edric murmured, uncertain of where his words were leading, but feeling the need to express something. Bull listened intently, and Edric drew himself nearer to Bull. "Dwarves have their ancestor and stone traditions, but damn, I'd suffocate underground. My stone sense is crap, and the only time I encountered lyrium was in Therinfall Redoubt. I'm a dwarf, but sometimes I feel like a short human."

For a moment, Edric felt like he had revealed too much to Bull. He and Sera had already formed a bond over their shared sense of being outcasts. Edric didn't fully understand what Bull was going through.

Bull tilted his head, hinting at turning to look at Edric, but refrained from doing so to avoid accidentally hitting Edric with his horns.

"Does that make me a horned human or your noble steed?" Bull quipped, though his attempt at humor seemed strained even to Edric.

"I don't think bulls are steeds for anyone but dirty farmers," Edric replied. He wasn't equipped to handle emotions in any other way than through humor, like Bull.

"Heh," Bull forced a brief chuckle before sighing resignedly. "It's not the same—you being a dwarf. You weren't born in Orzammar. You didn't abandon your people to come to the surface. You're not a disappointment."

Edric tensed and then swallowed hard. The word "disappointment" brought back memories of his family and the caste system. He suppressed his own feelings and let the weight of being deemed a disappointment settle in his stomach. 

"Yeah, but you knew," Edric murmured almost inaudibly. "You were practically Tal-Vashoth before joining the Inquisition. You are Tal-Vashoth, Bull, and it's pointless to dwell on what others think you should be."

Bull remained silent, and for a moment, Edric wished he could believe in Andraste to help him and Bull.

"I don't know much about Tal-Vashoth except for what you've told me, and you're you, Bull," Edric reassured. "Not those child-killing idiots..."

Bull stayed silent and tense. Edric rested his forehead against the back of Bull's head.

"And if you're afraid of becoming that, you have me, Krem, your—"
