--hand on Dorian’s shoulder was meant to comfort, but it felt stiff, and Varaad couldn’t help but worry about where they stood. This place was beautiful, and Varaad had thought a mainlander mansion would be a grand thing. But they were the only in the front rooms, the bedrooms to the side. 

This felt like they were being hidden away.

“We should talk to Calpernia,” Varaad said, and that meant something he didn’t mean to say out loud. 

Dorian chuckled, a quiet, sardonic thing that sounded strained. “Varaad, you remember where we are, don’t you?”

Varaad didn’t miss the hint.

“Yes, but I thought—”

“You thought wrong.”

There was no open anger in Dorian’s words, but Varaad shifted, pressed his lips in his mouth to keep his thoughts to himself.

The look Dorian shot him was sharp, and then it softened. “You don’t want them knowing about us,” he said, and Varaad felt the sadness as much as he heard it. When Dorian dropped his gaze, there was a vulnerability Varaad had never seen.

Varaad cursed himself silently. 

“Well, you’re not hiding Miriel,” he said stubbornly. “And I’m not hiding.”

“But I am,” Dorian snapped. His fists shook at his sides. “Hera and I have to. I don’t want to lose what I have there too.” 

Varaad couldn’t say what he wished to, he knew, and he looked away. He felt like a terrible partner for that. 

Dorian huffed a couple times before extracting himself from Varaad’s touch. 

Varaad turned to find he was alone and sighed. He thought he could hear a low-pitched growl in the room.
