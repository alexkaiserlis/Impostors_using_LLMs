The security officer at the barbed wire gate gave Jim a thorough once-over before glancing incredulously at his ID, making Jim suddenly overly conscious of his stained jeans and leather jacket. “Lt. Commander Spock has left instructions for you at the main guardhouse. Down the road, third door on the right.” The first sight that greeted him as he stepped from the turbolift was an ass. Spock’s ass, to be precise; round, firm, and sheathed in black fabric. Jim felt his mouth go dry. The muscles in the back of Spock’s thigh flexed enticingly as he leaned further down the Jeffries tube to reach for a tool. Jeans that had fit just fine this morning were suddenly too tight, and Jim reached as casually as possible to adjust himself. He coughed discreetly, not trusting his voice to work. The legs flexed again as Spock began to climb down, the fabric sliding smoothly across the inside of his knee. Jim tore his gaze away, forcing his eyes down, and attempting to control the flush rising in his neck. An engine tour, he reminded himself, not a first date. A look at mechanical bits, that's all. And if the tour guide just happens to be the hottest engineer known to sentient beings anywhere, well, that just doesn't enter into it. He raised his eyes to see the Vulcan studying him closely, his eyes dark and secretive, his lips full, and curling just slightly at the corners. God. He had a small smear of light blue hydraulics fluid near his left eye. Jim wanted to lick it off, slowly. “Greetings, Jim. I am pleased to see you.” Jim attempted to respond, fighting for his fair share of his limited blood supply. “Uhhmm... hi! Hope that, uh, part worked out for you?” He waved his hands in desperation. “Uh, thanks? For having me up? Very exciting?” He winced. What was he, twelve? So much for this guy ever wanting to see him again. Well, at least he'd get to see the Enterprise. He might as well make the most of it.
