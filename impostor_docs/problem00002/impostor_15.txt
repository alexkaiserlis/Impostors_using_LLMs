"The video was remarkable. I did see it. It was fantastic."

Zayn nudged Niall under the table, grinning. 

"So...have you shared it with your professor?" Niall inquired.

"Yeah, he adored it. He knows a man who possesses an art gallery and has managed to sell some of my paintings; he also wanted to sell it, but I refused. I want to cherish it for a while longer."

Niall nodded in understanding. "Yeah, I get that. I haven't seen any of your art, though."

"And I haven't heard you sing," Zayn joked. Niall beamed.

"I'll escort you to one of his gigs," Louis promised, before exclaiming in surprise as Harry slumped into the chair next to him. 

"Hey, darling," Harry greeted, chuckling at his disheveled boyfriend.

"How's drama going?" Zayn asked Louis after finishing greeting Harry.

"Fabulous! I completely adore drama," Louis replied enthusiastically. Harry leaned forward, his eyes gleaming.

"I've decided I'm going to have my own bakery someday."

"And I'll reside with him in the house above it. I'll watch him bake during the day, and he'll watch me act at night." Louis sighed dreamily, and Niall laughed.

"You're all sentimental," he said, his eyes sparkling. Zayn started to feel like his painting didn't do them justice, but he still liked it. Its image was imprinted in his mind.

Maybe he'd show it to Niall sometime.
