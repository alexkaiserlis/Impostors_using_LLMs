A month into Sherlockâ€™s return to life, Molly was still in her apartment when the consulting detective abruptly announced their trip to Glasgow. Irritated with his early and rude wake-up call, she voiced her annoyance as she got ready. Their awkward encounter in her room further exacerbated her frustration, and she decided to dress quickly, settling on a practical yet comfortable outfit for the trip. Despite Sherlock's abrupt demeanor, she agreed to accompany him and questioned him about their need to return before five, suggesting an idea to evade a dinner appointment. As Sherlock resisted her suggestion, Molly's patience waned, and she expressed her frustration with his complaints about his situation. Despite Sherlock's attempts to continue the discussion, Molly ended it and turned towards the hotel's entrance, leaving Sherlock to ponder her unexpected outburst.
