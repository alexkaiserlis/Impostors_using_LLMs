God explains to Sam and the others that angels do have free will, despite it being initially limited by God. She also explains her reasons for not directly interfering with their actions and the concept of miracles as her occasional interference due to her emotions. She emphasizes her love for all of her creation, human and angel, and gives insight into the complexity of her relationship with her children.
