You watch the ⚓️⚓️ with the right amount of light hidden without showing off the veins as much and accurately adding the size to make him look well endowed. Cronus was enamored by this photograph, like those advertisements for getting a larger ⚓️⚓️, and this image showcased the 'after' shot.

He slipped the file into the ⚖️ and waited. A moment later, it was accepted, and he couldn't turn back now, they drifted from the path of best buds, and the 'no homo' they put between each other was possibly breached.

Possibly.

DERP: wow cronus, that’s something I mean it looks I didn’t think you were going to do, but I’m impressed. 

CRT: yeah, you don't have to compliment it, I know I’m hot.

DERP: so what happens now?

That was a good question; what should they do?

By now, they had a few choices; pretend this never happened and delete both images, split up their long friendship over the fact that John had a ♀️ or turn this into a good thing where they learn more about each other in a different way. Cronus's ⚓️ seemed to like the last choice, still poking out of his crimson boxers and twitching in the cold air.

CRT: this could end up being a good thing, ⚖️ you and I, we could make something out of this.

DERP: what?

CRT: well, you know you've got a ♀️, I've got a ⚓️. Are you saying you want to have 🛏️ with me?

Dave felt guilty for suddenly making it awkward between them. He moved the picture of John to the side so he could still have a peek at it while typing.

CRT: you don’t have to if you don't want to I just thought that it would be easy since we are well, you know, both virgins.

The feeling of his ⚓️ throbbing brought him to the final conclusion that he needed to get off soon. He closed a loose fist around his member and pumped it steadily, feeling how much he ached for something like this to happen.

His ⚓️ could feel his need for 🐱, his want to be inside something, someone. He wanted to 🛏️ John.

He shut his 👀 as he masturbated slowly, wanting to draw it out as long as he could. He pictured in his head what John would be like in bed; nervous but ready to please, rubbing his 🌬️ and stuffing his fingers in his 👱‍♀️.

✗ he was so into the picture of John 🛏️ himself that he almost forgot about the chat until it made a noise.

DERP: I get what you're saying, but I dunno, what if it affects our friendship?

CRT: I promise it won’t ⚖️ your secret is safe with me, and we can experiment with each other as 🤝 bet your dying to know what a ⚓️ feels like.

He honestly didn't know where that came from; it was like an urge made him type that out, but he did think for a moment about how John would react to actually seeing a ⚓️.

Would he know what to do? Probably not since the whole virgin thing plus the ♀️ thing.

DERP: Dave, don't do that.

CRT: oh shit, did I offend you? I'm sorry dude.

Dave suddenly felt guilt writhe in his 🤢 John probably didn’t know what ⚓️ was like, and he might have had huge identity issues. This could have triggered him enough to actually get him depressed. His ⚓️ softened slightly with the little attention he was giving it, glancing at the ⚖️ to see what John had said.

DERP: no, it just saying stuff like that kinda made me wet.

CRT: oh, oh damn.

The blondes 👀 widened at the thought of John getting turned on by dirty talk. He could be rubbing at his folds right now, getting himself lubed up with his own 🐱 juice before 🛏️ himself with his fingers. The 🩸 flows to his ⚓️ once more to pulse heatedly. It couldn't hurt to get his best friend turned on more; he could have some fun with this.

CRT: you get hot and bothered by dirty talk? Didn’t know you had it in you, Egderp.

DERP: hey, dave, stop.

CRT: so your 🐱 likes it when I talk dirty? Oh my god, Dave, stop, what happens when you get wet? Do you rub at it and get yourself all ready for your fingers? Or do you have a toy that you use? The thought of you using a toy is just, wow.

John using a cute little vibrator to f*ck his 🐱, the wet sounds reverberating through Dave's 😔. Maybe he had a 🍑 and stuffed both his 🕳️ up while playing with his 🌬️.

Dave hadn't of thought like this about anyone before; John was definitely something special to him, but now he wanted more. 

DERP: I don’t have a toy, I just use my fingers.

CRT: shit, man.
