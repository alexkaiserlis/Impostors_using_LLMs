Peeta's back into his grip. Peeta tried to go with it, but Katniss could hear him groan, she wouldn’t shy about it-- she immediately felt his fingers slipping into her and then heard him groan.

“You’re so wet--oh my god--” Peeta laughed and brought up his thumb to rub at her clit. Katniss’ hips jerked, and she clutched at his shoulders for something to hold on to, burying her face in his neck because it felt too intense to meet his eyes. Her hips were moving without her permission to roll against the obscene pressure of his hand, aware of her own heartbeat, pounding in time with each throb of pleasure.

She came sooner than she wanted to. Warmth crested and broke over her body leaving her weak, slumped against Peeta’s side. She had hoped that climaxing would satiate the maddening drive but it was still dominant it broke through even the relaxed haze of her orgasm. She needed to come again, she was starving for it and the first one had only wet her appetite.
