He’d filed that exposing discomfort away as something unchangeable, like most things concerning armor, but he’d long since run out of the things he was willing to put up with while wearing it, especially for it to be this hard to take off of him at night. 

Varaad let out a quiet sigh as he dropped his hand and extended the letter in his hand toward the parchment-he’d recognize the design at a glance. His frown deepened as he finished reading it. He’d been dreading Dorian’s decision, but the actual words hit him hard nonetheless. His heart raced as he reread the letter, searching for some hope, some sign that Dorian’s absence might not be as permanent as it seemed. But there was no such thing. 

He slowly folded the letter back up and set it on his desk before burying his face in his hands. He didn’t know how he was supposed to handle this. It felt like the world was crumbling around him as he sat there, struggling to make sense of the abrupt departure. He knew Dorian’s reasons, he knew Dorian’s determination, and yet it didn’t make it any less painful. 

The scout’s knock on the door was an unwelcome interruption. Varaad straightened up and called for them to enter, knowing that it was time for him to put aside his own grief and lead his people. Duty came first, always.
