--Spock moves to the Christmas tree, inspecting its short, bedraggled branches adorned with ornaments as Jim explains its history. Turning to face Jim, Spock is greeted with the abrupt darkness caused by a power outage. Jim quickly retrieves a flashlight and a lantern from his supplies to provide light. As they contemplate the chilly room, there is a knock on the door, and the motel clerk informs them of the power outage due to temperature drop. Jim tersely dismisses the clerk and apologizes to Spock for the situation. They strategize to stay warm and ensure they have enough supplies.
