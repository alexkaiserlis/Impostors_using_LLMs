"Molly let him take the criminology project, but when he insisted on taking the lead for the pathology project, she put her foot down. They were discussing the issue in a library study room, a table between them as they argued.

“I have pathology as my career path! Pathology is my life! Of course it should be me!” Molly exclaimed. “You didn’t even get the diagnosis right when we looked at the file!”

“A technicality,” he waved his hand dismissively. “I got everything else right.”

“You knew what he had eaten a scone for tea,” she scoffed. “Not the project, not important. I figured it out.” She crossed her arms.

Sherlock stood up and placed his hands on the table. “I noticed the blueness of his skin.”

Molly stood up and mimicked his stance. “You thought he drowned.” She sneered.

“Drowning has very similar symptoms to the Spanish Flu. You could have easily made the same mistake if you didn’t feel the need to neurotically pick over the pictures,” he snapped. Molly’s eyes widened.

“I think that’s a good thing, considering you were wrong!” she spit back. “But you can’t just admit that, can you? No, the great Sherlock Holmes, wannabe detective, just has to be right all the time!”

“Wannabe detective?” Sherlock glared at his petite and irritating partner. “I have solved all of the ten cases the police have called me in on.”

Molly barked out a laugh. “You weren’t ‘called in’. You pushed your way in. They probably would have been fine solving it on their own. Professor Lestrade is an excellent detective.” She added with an admiration that irritated Sherlock.
