Midmorning found John sitting in his armchair, still contemplating the apparition he had seen the night before. He had barely interacted with Mary since then, and she, frustrated with Sherlock, had resolved to verbally confront him if given the chance. As Mary made breakfast, John finally stirred, but his thoughts were still consumed with his encounter with Sherlock. The bell rang, and when John answered it, he found Sherlock injured on the floor. Enraged, John initially confronted Sherlock, but Sherlock's sincere apology eventually softened John's anger, allowing a glimmer of forgiveness to emerge.
