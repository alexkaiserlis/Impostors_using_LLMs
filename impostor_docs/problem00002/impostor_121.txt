"Nah, I'm just thinking," Bull said, just as nonchalant as he ever was, but Edric's hands were on him; he could feel the tension coiled under Bull's skin. "The humans can believe whatever the hell they want—Andraste, that Vint dragon shit, Avvar sky mother crap—doesn't make them less human." 

Bull was acting blasé faire, like he was commenting on the color of the stone Andraste was made of and not human religion (well, human religion was about as interesting to Edric as the stone Andraste was made of), but Edric was young, not stupid. He could tell Bull had been worrying this for a while. 

Edric pressed further forward, pushing his chest against Bull's back in a way he hoped conveyed comfort because Edric was so bad at this, at being a rock in the way Bull so often was for him, and slid his hands down Bull's chest. He tapped out a nervous beat against his pecs, and immediately wanted to slam his forehead against something because who did that, who comforted someone by drumming on them? 

Bull audibly drew in a deep breath, and Edric pressed a soft kiss to the back of his head. 

“You’re like me,” Edric said softly, not sure where he was going but knew he needed to say something. Bull sat still, listening, and Edric pulled himself closer to Bull by the hands on his chest. “Dwarves have all that ancestor and stone stuff but hell, I’d die underground. Got stone sense for shit and the only time I’ve ever heard lyrium was that time we were in Therinfall Redoubt and the whole place was stuffed so full of red lyrium it nearly turned into one of those behemoth things. I’m a dwarf, but shit, I feel like a short human sometimes.”
