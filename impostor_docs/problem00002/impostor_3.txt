He honestly hadn't thought Bucky would remember. They'd been very discreet; it wasn't like there was much in the history books to trigger Bucky's memory.

“Yeah. Yeah we've – we were together for a long time.”

/Then why don't I remember having sex with you?/

“You're asexual Bucky. Well, I mean you were..."

“...yeah. I um. I am too, actually. It's part of why we got together.”

“So...what did we do? If we didn't have sex?”

“Well, we didn't do anything in public, obviously. But at home we cuddled and slept next to each other at night, and kissed sometimes. Mostly I just liked being next to you.”

“Were we happy?”

“Yeah. We were.”
