Dorrek's eyes lidded, trailing over Noh-Varr's spread form. "You belong all to me, don't you?" It's a statement, not a question, and Noh-Varr nods, satisfied and warm.

Just like coming home.

Noh-Varr rolls his hips as he's taken, athletic legs locking in place around Dorrek's waist. "Love it," he moans, "I love how you take me, my Emperor."

Dorrek slams into him until they're both shaking, caught in the release, before collapsing back on the bed. Resting, he can't help but admire Noh-Varr laid out beneath him, all flushed skin and straining muscles. Noh-Varr's chest heaves, sweat making his copper skin glisten.

He smiles, satisfied. "Such a good pet," Dorrek breathes, keeping his hand trailing warm possessively up and down Noh-Varr's side, reveling in the warmth of his skin.
