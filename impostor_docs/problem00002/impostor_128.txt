--pack, deciding that the hornless one wasn’t in danger after all, and blinked down at his own height to the hornless one’s before stopping just out of reach of him. He didn’t want to risk being pulled by grasp or trip over a limb and cause them both to fall. 

“Be still,” Adaar said again when the hornless man shifted slightly, the man’s face barely visible over the Ursaad’s black fur. The hornless man winced when Adaar reached down to pat the Ursaad, but the rest of his body shivered with a barely covered laugh. That was curious, but Adaar couldn’t figure out why. 

They probably looked like a strange, immobile huddle. 

The hornless man made to sign something with his hands, but he pulled his hands back to himself before doing more than crossing them over a dark spot. Adaar didn’t know what the sign was, but he knew that much at least: anger.  

It didn’t take him long to get the Ursaad untacked and settled for the night. The hornless man was even more as a problem. Adaar only had a vague idea of how he might have been injured, so there were multiple ways to untangle knots that Adaar needed to avoid lest he hurt him further. 

He refilled the water skins and checked his traps once after the hornless man was sleeping. Adaar didn’t make a lot of noise, less than the hornless man had made at least, but he still wondered if he should have awoken him. He couldn’t decide. 

He wouldn’t decide.
