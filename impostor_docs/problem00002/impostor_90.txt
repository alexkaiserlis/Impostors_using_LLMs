The fourth attempt to sway Kaneki's opinion didn't go well.

"This house is beautiful, Kaneki-kun," Tsukiyama said, admiring the trim, as he leaned against the door frame.

"It's conveniently located," Kaneki replied, changing into his workout clothes.

"It would be more useful to have everyone here," Tsukiyama continued.

"I do have everyone here," Kaneki said, grinning.

"Why?" Tsukiyama asked quietly.

Kaneki explained that he can't justify keeping a weapon in the house, and Tsukiyama's presence doesn't mesh well with the others.

Understanding this, Tsukiyama retired to the armory, offering to spar, but no efforts were needed. He left, satisfied with his place at Kaneki's side.
