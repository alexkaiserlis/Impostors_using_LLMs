Kon had gripped the straps of Tim's costume and pulled him in for a kiss, as Tim pushed him back. "What the hell is going on?!"

Tim grunted as Kon dropped him and stood up, asking, "Why did you let go?"

"I was kissing you!"

Tim smirked. "Yes..."

"And I didn't want to!"

Tim grinned. "Didn't you though?"

Kon sputtered then realized he did want to kiss Tim, badly. He was taken aback at the realization.

"What did you do to me?!"

"I'd say Warlock turned you gay..." Tim teased.

Kon was horrified until Tim revealed it was a lie, then they kissed again.

Later, Kon struggled, "You had Warlock put a spell on me? Why not grow back your eye?"

Tim shrugged. "I can get a cybernetic replacement for the eye. I can't get another Kryptonian fucktoy."

"I am not going to..." Kon insisted as he found himself firmly gripping Tim's ass. It was a very nice ass.

Tim challenged, "Aren't you? I've been carrying lube in my pocket for weeks."

Kon snapped, "You little shit!"

Then Kon flipped around, and Tim landed on top of him. He felt enraged and turned on at the same time. Ultimately, he gave in to his desires, knowing he would regret it later.

As Tim was about to orgasm, Kon stopped and demanded the lube. "You're not coming before I do," he asserted.
