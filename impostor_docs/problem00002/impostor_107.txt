“Stop,” Haise whispered, barely able to get the words out. “Please stop.”

The ghoul chuckled and pushed his hands lower, fingers brushing against Haise’s belt. “Can’t just means you don’t have the proper motivation. Do you think I’ll stop just because you tell me to?”

Haise shuddered and whined, trying to move himself away from the unwanted touch. The ghoul sat up with him, angling itself to look directly into Haise’s eyes. “Or maybe you want me to keep going.”

“Please no,” Haise begged, willing to degrade himself so long as the ghoul would just stop.

“Hmm, I know you’ve been eating enough, so it must be the motivation.” Haise felt a tug on the front of his pants, then a clank and a release as his buckle came undone. The ghoul’s hands slipped down his back, leaving the area where his kagune would come out in favor of fondling his buttocks. Unable to move away, Haise yelped as he felt a finger brush against his hole.
