The crews left, but we don't have to clear the building before leaving. You have never cleared the classrooms. You need to wait students might stay and we need to search the room to eliminate the presence of people who should not be there.  We need to catch anybody who should not be there. Even if they have to catch them at the end of the day. We have to be thorough in order to get rid of them. I don’t think it’ll help, but I know I have to do it.

They stopped and I suspect that they are close.

Oh, I wonder then, are they coming here?, he will be much. Please, hold tight as I have strength to endure. Hideeeee. Oh gosh. Please, I'll stop typing. I love you and you love me. So if we stay 20 minutes in here and then go, I have calculatedd that we will take 2 more minutes of these sweet lips for me.
