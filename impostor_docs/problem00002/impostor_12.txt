Levi habitually perched on the tower at dusk, watching Coruscant's lights extend as darkness descended. His ritual of meditation cleared his head and left him feeling blessedly alone, like when he was at the Academy. The tower, originally a landing pad, had been forgotten and became Levi's escape, thanks to the Council's absent-mindedness. As a Jedi Knight, he found himself spending more time there, especially after being assigned his first padawan, Eren. He felt a mix of frustration and pride towards Eren, particularly understanding the boy's actions due to the Fall of Shiganshina. The Titans' move to Tattooine only intensified the Jedi's involvement in the war, leading to heavy casualties and the loss of Tattooine. Levi, Erwin, and Bendo Ik returned to the Council, and the Order faced the repercussions of the loss.
