Adaar reluctantly walked away from trap twelve, trying to keep his focus on the task at hand and not on the injured man traveling with him. This man's presence was a distraction Adaar couldn't afford. The trek to the Ursaad was slow and tedious. The hornless man's movements, which had previously caused Adaar discomfort, had settled down, making the journey more manageable. As Adaar prepared to visit the remaining traps, the hornless man's restlessness returned, causing tension between them. Despite his irritation, Adaar tried to maintain control of the Ursaad, but the increasing discomfort and movement from the hornless man made it challenging. Adaar was relieved when they finally reached trap fifteen and he could head back to camp. However, his relief was short-lived when he noticed the hornless man's unusual stillness. Concerned, Adaar approached him, unsure of how to ease the tension that had developed between them. As he tried to discern the reason for the hornless man's behavior, Adaar couldn't shake off the feeling of awkwardness that surrounded them.
