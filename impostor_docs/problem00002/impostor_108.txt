The room closest to the stairwell was a good size with four beds and a cot already made up in it. Dorian mentioned that it would be the best room for the guards in case of an attack, and Sera immediately claimed one of the beds. Dorian warned her about playing pranks, but Sera didn't seem to mind. He then showed Varaad and Vivienne to a room across the hall. Vivienne settled in while Dorian invited Varaad to stay in his room, offering a cot just in case. Their reunion was filled with soft kisses before Dorian led them to a room in the back left of the building. The room was dimly lit by moonlight and contained a large four-poster bed and a wooden cot. Miriel interrupted to announce that the stew was ready, and Varaad questioned Dorian about Calpernia's knowledge of Miriel's presence. Dorian assured him that Miriel was not a slave but an employee and explained that she called him "Master" due to her previous abusive master. Varaad felt relieved but noticed Dorian's stress and offered a comforting hand on his shoulder.
