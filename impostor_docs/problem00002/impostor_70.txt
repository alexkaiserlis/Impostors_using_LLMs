I've collected several specimens today. They are currently in their vacuum-sealed packages, so there shouldn't be any concerns about depressurization. The only issue would be potential temperature fluctuations when the Hab deflated. The exact range of temperature tolerance for the seeds isn't known, but based on my expertise, there's a strong possibility they will germinate.

To ensure their successful growth, I'll re-sow the bacteria in the soil tomorrow. It's essential to have fertile soil for my potential food source. It's going to be physically taxing, though.

I'm pleased to report that I have a sprout! It's where I planted the beans, particularly black beans, which are known for their robustness. However, they require careful handling to produce a good yield.

On the downside, it seems unlikely that the peas will germinate if the beans have sprouted first. Nonetheless, I'm grateful to have the beans to sustain me until the Iris probe arrives. I've prepared metal stakes to support the beans as they grow, and they will receive the best care I can provide as the planet's foremost botanist.

I also sent a message to Martinez, expressing my gratitude for his invaluable contributions to our mission. Without his efforts, I would have faced severe challenges in sustaining myself.

Today, my crewmates safely returned to Earth. They'll undergo medical evaluation and deconditioning to adapt to Earth's gravity. I hope they won't face undue scrutiny about leaving me behind. They made the right decision, and I stand by it.

On the bright side, they can now correspond with me more quickly, and I'm eager to hear from them.

I'm facing a crisis: nearly all the prepackaged food is depleted, leaving me with only 12 meals for the next 192 days before the Iris probe arrives.
