Leaving for Tevinter in the morning was a quiet slip out. A gentle humanity fell upon him, tying him to their label's paper. Varaad rose from the desk and let out a quiet sigh.

With a timid knock on the door, he blinked away the stars. The scout shuffled in, passing a letter from Serah Pavus. Varaad's confusion and concern were evident. Dorian had left for Tevinter that morning, leaving the letter with the scout. 

After she left, Varaad tried to compose himself and read the letter with care. Dorian expressed his need to return to Tevinter to bring about change, but also urged Varaad not to follow. He emphasized the importance of Varaad's role in Skyhold and the Inquisition, and expressed faith in their ability to endure the separation. He reassured Varaad that Leliana had helped plan his route into Tevinter, ensuring his safety.
