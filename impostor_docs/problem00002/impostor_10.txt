perch, their lights seemingly elongated by their swiftness. This was the norm for Sherlock Holmes, a routine he never missed. Every evening, he would retire to his couch at 221 B. Baker Street and relax, while his friend Dr. John Watson observed from the doorway.

"You're just going to lie there. You were almost killed, and all you're going to do is lay on the couch," remarked Dr. Watson, taking his usual seat across from Sherlock.

"I wasn't startled, I wasn't caught off guard; there's no reason for me to deviate from my usual routine," replied Sherlock, sitting up and scrutinizing John.

"Your 'usual routine'?" inquired John, puzzled.

"I presume you and I would have comparable responses, then," Sherlock interjected, striding to the fireplace.

"Yeah, I thought so," John shrugged, feeling uncomfortable under Sherlock's piercing gaze.

Sherlock returned to the couch, and John noticed something odd.

"Why are you still wearing your coat?" questioned John, and Sherlock, realizing his oversight, promptly removed his coat and left the room abruptly. Mrs. Hudson entered, expressing concern over Sherlock's departure without his overcoat, prompting John to reassure her that everything was fine.
