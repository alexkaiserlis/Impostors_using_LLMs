---it was his time to finish the task Commander Rellet had given him. Lyon looked around at the rushing crowd in the market square, scattered among the chaos of shouts and laughter. He spotted a ragged figure darting through the throng, an easy to ignore piece in the tapestry of bodies. Lyon clenched his teeth, setting his square jaw with determination as he pushed through the crowd in pursuit of the figure. He reached out, his hand brushing against the figure's cloak, and they stopped abruptly.

"Message for you, Ser," the figure muttered, passing a scrap of parchment into Lyon's hand. It was a heavy, unusual design, and Lyon recognized it from the commander's desk.

"Who is this from?" Lyon demanded, his voice tense with confusion.

"Serah Rellet, Ser," the figure replied. Lyon's mind raced, thoughts of his previous assignments and finalizing his mission. He couldn't let the weight of the message distract him from the task at hand. 

"Thank you," Lyon said, trying to conceal his unease. The figure promptly departed, and Lyon exhaled deeply. His heart was racing as he unfolded the message. His multi-faced assignment was about to take another unexpected turn.
